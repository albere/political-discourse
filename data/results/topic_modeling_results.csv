Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I'm honored by your support, and I
accept your nomination for President of the United States.
When I -- When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what
these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet
morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a
doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shaken
economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain
strongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that
would make the men of Normandy proud.
Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them.
Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we
have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness in
our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us
back.

In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice
President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and
I'm honored to have him at my side.
I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans -- Americans have come to
see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First
Lady.
I'm a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women.
I'm blessed with a sister and brothers who are my closest friends. And I will always be the
proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.
My father served eight years at the side of another great American: Ronald Reagan. His -- His
spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and are in our hearts, and will
always define our Party.
Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the
convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contest
for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this
country in the next four years.
I believe -- I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed the
most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making
sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will
hold us back.
I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors, so I brought Republicans
and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help
buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, and
nothing will hold us back.
I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and
ranchers, so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because we
acted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.

I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If
America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy.
This will not happen on my watch.
I'm running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more
hopeful America. I'm running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government
should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants
steady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win this
election.
The story -- The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle,
constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment is
still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of
freedom.
The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents'
generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that provided
health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs,
even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society
has seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home.
This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better
living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your
side. Many of our most fundamental systems -- the tax code, health coverage, pension plans,
worker training -- were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform
these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared, and thus truly free to make your
own choices and pursue your own dreams.
My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now
compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition for
our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to
do business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining
federal spending, reducing regulation, and making the tax relief permanent. To create jobs,
we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we will
expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe.
And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous
lawsuits that threaten jobs across our country.

Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled with
special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork
and headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands a
simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and
simplify the federal tax code.
Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding
economy to find better and higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to
go back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number of
people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for our community
colleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone,
anywhere in the world.
In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To
stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and
other jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we will provide tax relief
and other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bring
hope and work throughout all of America.
As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have told
me that they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are
small business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join
together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax
credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts,
and provide -- and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These
accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save
tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account
with you whenever you change jobs. We will provide low-income Americans with better access
to health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or
rural health center.
As I've traveled our country, I've met too many good doctors, especially OBGYNS, who are
being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more
affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to
improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors
and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.

In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we
will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand
in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.
Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings
security, and dignity, and independence. Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is
at an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in the
next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my
home.
In an ownership society, more people will own their health care plans, and have the
confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We'll always keep the promise of Social
Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement,
many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be
there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to
save some of their taxes in a personal -- personal account, a nest egg you can call your own,
and government can never take away.
In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path -- a
path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life. And the path
begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our
children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind every
parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter
where you live, your school will be the path to promise of America.
We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting
on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in
charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help -- and
we are providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia,
Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor -- and this year 90
percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal -- The principal
expresses the philosophy of his school this way: ""We don't focus on what we can't do at this
school; we focus on what we can do. And we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish
line."" See, this principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is the
spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningún
niño atrás. ""We will leave no child behind.""

We are making progress -- We are making and there is more to do. In this time of change,
most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one in
four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help
students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will
require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and
expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start
their career with a college diploma.
America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an
aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the
government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information,
to stand between these children and the health care they need.
Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find 'em online. The web address is not
very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com.
These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a
choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed
Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now
wants to dilute 'em. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the
marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, opposed lowering income taxes for all
who pay them. (Wait a minute. Wait a minute.) To be fair, there are some things my
opponent is for. He's -- He's proposed more than two trillion dollars in federal spending so far,
and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. And to pay for that spending, he is
runnin' on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually
keeps.
His tax and -- His policies of tax and spend, of expanding government rather than expanding
opportunity are the politics of the past. We are on the path to the future and we're not turning
back.
In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the
institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of
responsibility and character and family commitment.

Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that
strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakest
members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because -- Because religious charities
provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate
against them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our
society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue to
appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict
interpretation of the law.
My opponent recently announced that he's the conservative -- the candidate of ""conservative
values."" Must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. There are some problems
with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you
are not the candidate of conservative values. If -- If you voted against the bipartisan Defense
of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative
values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight years
of ""moral darkness,"" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values
is not one of them.
This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism.
And you know where I stand. Three days after September the 11th, I stood where Americans
died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, ""Whatever it
takes."" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, ""Do not let me down."" Since that day, I
wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in
defending America whatever it takes.
So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the
lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We've tripled funding for homeland
security and trained a half a million first responders, because we're determined to protect our
homeland. We're transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence
services. We are staying on the offensive, striking terrorists abroad, so we do not have to face
them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East,
because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail.
Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida;
Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups; Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist
fundraising; Libya was secretly pursuing nucular [nuclear] weapons; Iraq was a gathering
threat; and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks.

Today, the government of -- of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror; Pakistan is capturing
terrorist leaders; Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests; Libya is dismantling its weapons
programs; the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom; and more than three-quarters of al-
Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led; many have
joined; and America and the world are safer.
This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And
the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for
terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. And
we know that September the 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and we
will, confront threats to America before it is too late.
In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including --. Members
of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and
voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which
passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences.
Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we
gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the
civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval
Office, a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the
lessons of September the 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend
our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.
Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the
Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is
coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can
to intimidate people, yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October
presidential election -- a resounding endorsement for democracy. Despite ongoing acts of
violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are
scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq,
because when America gives its word, America must keep its word.
As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free
societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and
breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of
harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace.

So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies,
and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as
possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.
Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: ""We
are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place. The various terrorist enemies we
are facing in Iraq,"" he continued, ""are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a
test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories in
confronting the evil terrorists."" That young man is right -- our men and women in uniform are
doing a superb job for America.
Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of
historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists
where they live and plan, and you're making America safer. Because of you, women in
Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no
longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just
and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will
give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.
Again -- Again my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress
overwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle in
Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets,
and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, ""I
actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it."" Then he said -- Then he
said he was ""proud"" of his vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a ""complicated"" matter.
There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.
Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in
Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders
like Prime Minister Howard, President Kwasniewski, Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course,
Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called American
allies, quote, a ""coalition of the coerced and the bribed."" That would be nations like Great
Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others --
allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician.

I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history.
America is grateful, and America will not forget.
The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me
in the Oval Office. They had ""X""s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been
cut off by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes.
During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write
out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the
hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth.
Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a
vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical
ideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope and purpose and dignity do not
strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all
their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear, and they should be afraid,
because freedom is on the march.
I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to
advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example
will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that
democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel.
Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and
justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are
found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers and political prisoners and exiles will hear
the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances
heart by heart, and nation by nation America will be more secure and the world more
peaceful.
America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18
months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist in the New York Times wrote this:
""Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. European capitals
are frightened. In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost
to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.""

Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolute
president named Truman, who, with the American people, persevered -- knowing that a new
democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that
generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world
today.
The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come
easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of
liberty to transform lives and nations.
That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin
of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to
aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan, Nicaragua, Central Europe and the Baltics.
And that noble story goes on.
I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century.
I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty.
I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government
ever devised by man.
I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the Almighty
God's gift to every man and woman in this world.
This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept
our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment and used it to
build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of our
Nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.
In the last four years -- In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even
when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand.
You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. I
knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at me
and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called ""walking."" Now and then I come across as
a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.

One thing I have learned about the presidency is that whatever shortcomings you have,
people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're gonna need 'em.
These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I've tried to
comfort Americans who lost the most on September the 11th -- people who showed me a
picture or told me a story, so I'd -- I would know how much was taken from them. I've
learned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is
right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead,
who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who were told their
dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their mom or dad.
I've met with the parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said a
final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to
say that I'm in their prayers -- and to offer encouragement to me. Where does that strength
like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is
because they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty
was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of
a great nation: decent, idealistic, and strong.
The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced peril
together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage.
My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of
New York City and they will say: Here buildings fell; here a nation rose.
We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one.
We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry.
We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again.
We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with
their effort and optimism.
And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and
confident Nation can achieve anything.
To everything we know there is a season -- a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for
rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope.

This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer
world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations
before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the
everlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed.
Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future
of the greatest nation on earth.
God bless you, and may God continue to bless our great country.
Thank you all.

I accept your nomination for President of the United States of America.

I do so with humility, deeply moved by the trust you have placed in me. It is a great honor. It is an even greater responsibility.

Tonight I am asking you to join me to walk together to a better future. By my side, I have chosen a man with a big heart from a small town. He represents the best of America, a man who will always make us proud - my friend and America's next Vice President, Paul Ryan.

In the days ahead, you will get to know Paul and Janna better. But last night America got to see what I saw in Paul Ryan - a strong and caring leader who is down to earth and confident in the challenge this moment demands.

I love the way he lights up around his kids and how he's not embarrassed to show the world how much he loves his mom.

But Paul, I still like the playlist on my iPod better than yours.

Four years ago, I know that many Americans felt a fresh excitement about the possibilities of a new president. That president was not the choice of our party but Americans always come together after elections. We are a good and generous people who are united by so much more than what divides us.

When that hard fought election was over, when the yard signs came down and the television commercials finally came off the air, Americans were eager to go back to work, to live our lives the way Americans always have - optimistic and positive and confident in the future.

That very optimism is uniquely American.

It is what brought us to America. We are a nation of immigrants. We are the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the ones who wanted a better life, the driven ones, the ones who woke up at night hearing that voice telling them that life in that place called America could be better.

They came not just in pursuit of the riches of this world but for the richness of this life.

Freedom.

Freedom of religion.

Freedom to speak their mind.

Freedom to build a life.

And yes, freedom to build a business. With their own hands.

This is the essence of the American experience.

We Americans have always felt a special kinship with the future.

When every new wave of immigrants looked up and saw the Statue of Liberty, or knelt down and kissed the shores of freedom just ninety miles from Castro's tyranny, these new Americans surely had many questions. But none doubted that here in America they could build a better life, that in America their children would be more blessed than they.

But today, four years from the excitement of the last election, for the first time, the majority of Americans now doubt that our children will have a better future.

It is not what we were promised.

Every family in America wanted this to be a time when they could get ahead a little more, put aside a little more for college, do more for their elderly mom who's living alone now or give a little more to their church or charity.

Every small business wanted these to be their best years ever, when they could hire more, do more for those who had stuck with them through the hard times, open a new store or sponsor that Little League team.

Every new college graduate thought they'd have a good job by now, a place of their own, and that they could start paying back some of their loans and build for the future.

This is when our nation was supposed to start paying down the national debt and rolling back those massive deficits.

This was the hope and change America voted for.

It's not just what we wanted. It's not just what we expected.

It's what Americans deserved.

You deserved it because during these years, you worked harder than ever before. You deserved it because when it cost more to fill up your car, you cut out movie nights and put in longer hours. Or when you lost that job that paid $22.50 an hour with benefits, you took two jobs at 9 bucks an hour and fewer benefits. You did it because your family depended on you. You did it because you're an American and you don't quit. You did it because it was what you had to do.

But driving home late from that second job, or standing there watching the gas pump hit 50 dollars and still going, when the realtor told you that to sell your house you'd have to take a big loss, in those moments you knew that this just wasn't right.

But what could you do? Except work harder, do with less, try to stay optimistic. Hug your kids a little longer; maybe spend a little more time praying that tomorrow would be a better day.

I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed. But his promises gave way to disappointment and division. This isn't something we have to accept. Now is the moment when we CAN do something. With your help we will do something.

Now is the moment when we can stand up and say, ""I'm an American. I make my destiny. And we deserve better! My children deserve better! My family deserves better. My country deserves better!""

So here we stand. Americans have a choice. A decision.

To make that choice, you need to know more about me and about where I will lead our country.

I was born in the middle of the century in the middle of the country, a classic baby boomer. It was a time when Americans were returning from war and eager to work. To be an American was to assume that all things were possible. When President Kennedy challenged Americans to go to the moon, the question wasn't whether we'd get there, it was only when we'd get there.

The soles of Neil Armstrong's boots on the moon made permanent impressions on OUR souls and in our national psyche. Ann and I watched those steps together on her parent's sofa. Like all Americans we went to bed that night knowing we lived in the greatest country in the history of the world.

God bless Neil Armstrong.

Tonight that American flag is still there on the moon. And I don't doubt for a second that Neil Armstrong's spirit is still with us: that unique blend of optimism, humility and the utter confidence that when the world needs someone to do the really big stuff, you need an American.

That's how I was brought up.

My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution. I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US Government as war refugees. My dad never made it through college and apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he had big dreams. He convinced my mom, a beautiful young actress, to give up Hollywood to marry him. He moved to Detroit, led a great automobile company and became Governor of the Great State of Michigan.

We were Mormons and growing up in Michigan; that might have seemed unusual or out of place but I really don't remember it that way. My friends cared more about what sports teams we followed than what church we went to.

My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would BE, and much less about what we would DO.

Unconditional love is a gift that Ann and I have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren. All the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers. If every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family - and God's love — this world would be a far more gentle and better place.

Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.

My mom and dad were true partners, a life lesson that shaped me by everyday example. When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, ""Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?""

I wish she could have been here at the convention and heard leaders like Governor Mary Fallin, Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Susana Martinez, Senator Kelly Ayotte and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

As Governor of Massachusetts, I chose a woman Lt. Governor, a woman chief of staff, half of my cabinet and senior officials were women, and in business, I mentored and supported great women leaders who went on to run great companies.

I grew up in Detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy, like my dad. But by the time I was out of school, I realized that I had to go out on my own, that if I stayed around Michigan in the same business, I'd never really know if I was getting a break because of my dad. I wanted to go someplace new and prove myself.

Those weren't the easiest of days - too many long hours and weekends working, five young sons who seemed to have this need to re-enact a different world war every night. But if you ask Ann and I what we'd give, to break up just one more fight between the boys, or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room. Well, every mom and dad knows the answer to that.

Those days were toughest on Ann, of course. She was heroic. Five boys, with our families a long way away. I had to travel a lot for my job then and I'd call and try to offer support. But every mom knows that doesn't help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school.

I knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine. And I knew without question, that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine. And as America saw Tuesday night, Ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to.

Like a lot of families in a new place with no family, we found kinship with a wide circle of friends through our church. When we were new to the community it was welcoming and as the years went by, it was a joy to help others who had just moved to town or just joined our church. We had remarkably vibrant and diverse congregants from all walks of life and many who were new to America. We prayed together, our kids played together and we always stood ready to help each other out in different ways.

And that's how it is in America. We look to our communities, our faiths, our families for our joy, our support, in good times and bad. It is both how we live our lives and why we live our lives. The strength and power and goodness of America has always been based on the strength and power and goodness of our communities, our families, our faiths.

That is the bedrock of what makes America, America. In our best days, we can feel the vibrancy of America's communities, large and small.

It's when we see that new business opening up downtown. It's when we go to work in the morning and see everybody else on our block doing the same.

It's when our son or daughter calls from college to talk about which job offer they should take....and you try not to choke up when you hear that the one they like is not far from home.

It's that good feeling when you have more time to volunteer to coach your kid's soccer team, or help out on school trips.

But for too many Americans, these good days are harder to come by. How many days have you woken up feeling that something really special was happening in America?

Many of you felt that way on Election Day four years ago. Hope and Change had a powerful appeal. But tonight I'd ask a simple question: If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn't you feel that way now that he's President Obama? You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.

The President hasn't disappointed you because he wanted to. The President has disappointed America because he hasn't led America in the right direction. He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business. Jobs to him are about government.

I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience.

When I was 37, I helped start a small company. My partners and I had been working for a company that was in the business of helping other businesses.

So some of us had this idea that if we really believed our advice was helping companies, we should invest in companies. We should bet on ourselves and on our advice.

So we started a new business called Bain Capital. The only problem was, while WE believed in ourselves, nobody else did. We were young and had never done this before and we almost didn't get off the ground. In those days, sometimes I wondered if I had made a really big mistake. I had thought about asking my church's pension fund to invest, but I didn't. I figured it was bad enough that I might lose my investors' money, but I didn't want to go to hell too. Shows what I know. Another of my partners got the Episcopal Church pension fund to invest. Today there are a lot of happy retired priests who should thank him.

That business we started with 10 people has now grown into a great American success story. Some of the companies we helped start are names you know. An office supply company called Staples - where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping; The Sports Authority, which became a favorite of my sons. We started an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised. At a time when nobody thought we'd ever see a new steel mill built in America, we took a chance and built one in a corn field in Indiana. Today Steel Dynamics is one of the largest steel producers in the United States.

These are American success stories. And yet the centerpiece of the President's entire re-election campaign is attacking success. Is it any wonder that someone who attacks success has led the worst economic recovery since the Great Depression? In America, we celebrate success, we don't apologize for it.

We weren't always successful at Bain. But no one ever is in the real world of business.

That's what this President doesn't seem to understand. Business and growing jobs is about taking risk, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding, but always striving. It is about dreams. Usually, it doesn't work out exactly as you might have imagined. Steve Jobs was fired at Apple. He came back and changed the world.

It's the genius of the American free enterprise system - to harness the extraordinary creativity and talent and industry of the American people with a system that is dedicated to creating tomorrow's prosperity rather than trying to redistribute today's.

That is why every president since the Great Depression who came before the American people asking for a second term could look back at the last four years and say with satisfaction: ""you are better off today than you were four years ago.""

Except Jimmy Carter. And except this president.

This president can ask us to be patient.

This president can tell us it was someone else's fault.

This president can tell us that the next four years he'll get it right.

But this president cannot tell us that YOU are better off today than when he took office.

Americahas been patient. Americans have supported this president in good faith.

But today, the time has come to turn the page.

Today the time has come for us to put the disappointments of the last four years behind us.

To put aside the divisiveness and the recriminations.

To forget about what might have been and to look ahead to what can be.

Now is the time to restore the Promise of America. Many Americans have given up on this president but they haven't ever thought about giving up. Not on themselves. Not on each other. And not on America.

What is needed in our country today is not complicated or profound. It doesn't take a special government commission to tell us what America needs.

What America needs is jobs.

Lots of jobs.

In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before. Nearly one out of six Americans is living in poverty. Look around you. These are not strangers. These are our brothers and sisters, our fellow Americans.

His policies have not helped create jobs, they have depressed them. And this I can tell you about where President Obama would take America:

His plan to raise taxes on small business won't add jobs, it will eliminate them;

His assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China;

His trillion dollar cuts to our military will eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and also put our security at greater risk;

His $716 billion cut to Medicare to finance Obamacare will both hurt today's seniors, and depress innovation - and jobs - in medicine.

And his trillion-dollar deficits will slow our economy, restrain employment, and cause wages to stall.

To the majority of Americans who now believe that the future will not be better than the past, I can guarantee you this: if Barack Obama is re-elected, you will be right.

I am running for president to help create a better future. A future where everyone who wants a job can find one. Where no senior fears for the security of their retirement. An America where every parent knows that their child will get an education that leads them to a good job and a bright horizon.

And unlike the President, I have a plan to create 12 million new jobs. It has 5 steps.

First, by 2020, North America will be energy independent by taking full advantage of our oil and coal and gas and nuclear and renewables.

Second, we will give our fellow citizens the skills they need for the jobs of today and the careers of tomorrow. When it comes to the school your child will attend, every parent should have a choice, and every child should have a chance.

Third, we will make trade work for America by forging new trade agreements. And when nations cheat in trade, there will be unmistakable consequences.

Fourth, to assure every entrepreneur and every job creator that their investments in America will not vanish as have those in Greece, we will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget.

And fifth, we will champion SMALL businesses, America's engine of job growth. That means reducing taxes on business, not raising them. It means simplifying and modernizing the regulations that hurt small business the most. And it means that we must rein in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare by repealing and replacing Obamacare.

Today, women are more likely than men to start a business. They need a president who respects and understands what they do.

And let me make this very clear - unlike President Obama, I will not raise taxes on the middle class.

As president, I will protect the sanctity of life. I will honor the institution of marriage. And I will guarantee America's first liberty: the freedom of religion.

President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. MY promise...is to help you and your family.

I will begin my presidency with a jobs tour. President Obama began with an apology tour. America, he said, had dictated to other nations. No Mr. President, America has freed other nations from dictators.

Every American was relieved the day President Obama gave the order, and Seal Team Six took out Osama bin Laden. But on another front, every American is less secure today because he has failed to slow Iran's nuclear threat.

In his first TV interview as president, he said we should talk to Iran. We're still talking, and Iran's centrifuges are still spinning.

President Obama has thrown allies like Israel under the bus, even as he has relaxed sanctions on Castro's Cuba. He abandoned our friends in Poland by walking away from our missile defense commitments, but is eager to give Russia's President Putin the flexibility he desires, after the election. Under my administration, our friends will see more loyalty, and Mr. Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone.

We will honor America's democratic ideals because a free world is a more peaceful world. This is the bipartisan foreign policy legacy of Truman and Reagan. And under my presidency we will return to it once again.

You might have asked yourself if these last years are really the America we want, the America won for us by the greatest generation.

Does the America we want borrow a trillion dollars from China? No.

Does it fail to find the jobs that are needed for 23 million people and for half the kids graduating from college? No.

Are its schools lagging behind the rest of the developed world? No.

And does the America we want succumb to resentment and division? We know the answer.

The America we all know has been a story of the many becoming one, uniting to preserve liberty, uniting to build the greatest economy in the world, uniting to save the world from unspeakable darkness.

Everywhere I go in America, there are monuments that list those who have given their lives for America. There is no mention of their race, their party affiliation, or what they did for a living. They lived and died under a single flag, fighting for a single purpose. They pledged allegiance to the UNITED States of America.

That America, that united America, can unleash an economy that will put Americans back to work, that will once again lead the world with innovation and productivity, and that will restore every father and mother's confidence that their children's future is brighter even than the past.

That America, that united America, will preserve a military that is so strong, no nation would ever dare to test it.

That America, that united America, will uphold the constellation of rights that were endowed by our Creator, and codified in our Constitution.

That united America will care for the poor and the sick, will honor and respect the elderly, and will give a helping hand to those in need.

That America is the best within each of us. That America we want for our children.

If I am elected President of these United States, I will work with all my energy and soul to restore that America, to lift our eyes to a better future. That future is our destiny. That future is out there. It is waiting for us. Our children deserve it, our nation depends upon it, the peace and freedom of the world require it. And with your help we will deliver it. Let us begin that future together tonight.",0.0,0.0,0.9930673837661743,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

I accept your nomination. Thank you for this honor. Together, we will renew America's purpose.

Our founders first defined that purpose here in Philadelphia... Ben Franklin was here. Thomas Jefferson. And, of course, George Washington -- or, as his friends called him, ""George W.""

I am proud to have Dick Cheney at my side. He is a man of integrity and sound judgment, who has proven that public service can be noble service. America will be proud to have a leader of such character to succeed Al Gore as Vice President of the United States.

I am grateful for John McCain and the other candidates who sought this nomination. Their convictions strengthen our party.

I am especially grateful tonight to my family.

No matter what else I do in life, asking Laura to marry me was the best decision I ever made.

To our daughters, Barbara and Jenna, we love you, we're proud of you, and as you head off to college this fall...... Don't stay out too late, and e-mail your old dad once in a while, will you?

And mother, everyone loves you and so do I.

Growing up, she gave me love and lots of advice. I gave her white hair. And I want to thank my father -- the most decent man I have ever known. All my life I have been amazed that a gentle soul could be so strong. And Dad, I want you to know how proud I am to be your son.

My father was the last president of a great generation. A generation of Americans who stormed beaches, liberated concentration camps and delivered us from evil.

Some never came home.

Those who did put their medals in drawers, went to work, and built on a heroic scale... highways and universities, suburbs and factories, great cities and grand alliances -- the strong foundations of an American Century.

Now the question comes to the sons and daughters of this achievement...

What is asked of us?

This is a remarkable moment in the life of our nation. Never has the promise of prosperity been so vivid. But times of plenty, like times of crisis, are tests of American character.

Prosperity can be a tool in our hands -- used to build and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system -- dulling our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty.

Our opportunities are too great, our lives too short, to waste this moment.

So tonight we vow to our nation...

We will seize this moment of American promise.

We will use these good times for great goals.

We will confront the hard issues -- threats to our national security, threats to our health and retirement security -- before the challenges of our time become crises for our children.

And we will extend the promise of prosperity to every forgotten corner of this country.

To every man and woman, a chance to succeed. To every child, a chance to learn. To every family, a chance to live with dignity and hope.

For eight years, the Clinton/Gore administration has coasted through prosperity.

And the path of least resistance is always downhill.

But America's way is the rising road.

This nation is daring and decent and ready for change.

Our current president embodied the potential of a generation. So many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no great purpose.

Little more than a decade ago, the Cold War thawed and, with the leadership of Presidents Reagan and Bush, that wall came down.

But instead of seizing this moment, the Clinton/Gore administration has squandered it. We have seen a steady erosion of American power and an unsteady exercise of American influence.

Our military is low on parts, pay and morale.

If called on by the commander-in-chief today, two entire divisions of the Army would have to report... Not ready for duty, sir.

This administration had its moment.

They had their chance. They have not led. We will.

This generation was given the gift of the best education in American history. Yet we do not share that gift with everyone. Seven of ten fourth-graders in our highest poverty schools cannot read a simple children's book.

And still this administration continues on the same old path with the same old programs -- while millions are trapped in schools where violence is common and learning is rare.

This administration had its chance. They have not led. We will.

America has a strong economy and a surplus. We have the public resources and the public will -- even the bipartisan opportunities -- to strengthen Social Security and repair Medicare.

But this administration -- during eight years of increasing need -- did nothing.

They had their moment. They have not led. We will.

Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values -- to show we have grown up before we grow old.

But when the moment for leadership came, this administration did not teach our children, it disillusioned them.

They had their chance. They have not led. We will.

And now they come asking for another chance, another shot.

Our answer?

Not this time.

Not this year.

This is not a time for third chances, it is a time for new beginnings. The rising generations of this country have our own appointment with greatness.

It does not rise or fall with the stock market. It cannot be bought with our wealth.

Greatness is found when American character and American courage overcome American challenges.

When Lewis Morris of New York was about to sign the Declaration of Independence, his brother advised against it, warning he would lose all his property.

Morris, a plain-spoken Founder, responded... ""Damn the consequences, give me the pen."" That is the eloquence of American action.

We heard it during World War II, when General Eisenhower told paratroopers on D-Day morning not to worry -- and one replied, ""We're not worried, General... It's Hitler's turn to worry now.""

We heard it in the civil rights movement, when brave men and women did not say... ""We shall cope,"" or ""We shall see."" They said... ""We shall overcome.""

An American president must call upon that character.

Tonight, in this hall, we resolve to be, not the party of repose, but the party of reform.

We will write, not footnotes, but chapters in the American story.

We will add the work of our hands to the inheritance of our fathers and mothers -- and leave this nation greater than we found it.

We know the tests of leadership. The issues are joined.

We will strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the greatest generation, and for generations to come.

Medicare does more than meet the needs of our elderly, it reflects the values of our society.

We will set it on firm financial ground, and make prescription drugs available and affordable for every senior who needs them.

Social Security has been called the ""third rail of American politics"" -- the one you're not supposed to touch because it shocks you.

But, if you don't touch it, you can't fix it. And I intend to fix it.

To seniors in this country... You earned your benefits, you made your plans, and President George W. Bush will keep the promise of Social Security... no changes, no reductions, no way.

Our opponents will say otherwise. This is their last, parting ploy, and don't believe a word of it.

Now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to end the politics of fear and save Social Security, together.

For younger workers, we will give you the option -- your choice -- to put a part of your payroll taxes into sound, responsible investments.

This will mean a higher return on your money, and, over 30 or 40 years, a nest egg to help your retirement, or pass along to your children.

When this money is in your name, in your account, it's not just a program, it's your property.

Now is the time to give American workers security and independence that no politician can ever take away.

On education... Too many American children are segregated into schools without standards, shuffled from grade-to-grade because of their age, regardless of their knowledge.

This is discrimination, pure and simple -- the soft bigotry of low expectations.

And our nation should treat it like other forms of discrimination... We should end it.

One size does not fit all when it comes to educating our children, so local people should control local schools.

And those who spend your tax dollars must be held accountable.

When a school district receives federal funds to teach poor children, we expect them to learn. And if they don't, parents should get the money to make a different choice.

Now is the time to make Head Start an early learning program, teach all our children to read, and renew the promise of America's public schools. Another test of leadership is tax relief.

The last time taxes were this high as a percentage of our economy, there was a good reason... We were fighting World War II.

Today, our high taxes fund a surplus. Some say that growing federal surplus means Washington has more money to spend.

But they've got it backwards.

The surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.

I will use this moment of opportunity to bring common sense and fairness to the tax code.

And I will act on principle.

On principle... every family, every farmer and small businessperson, should be free to pass on their life's work to those they love.

So we will abolish the death tax.

On principle... no one in America should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government.

So we will reduce tax rates for everyone, in every bracket.

On principle... those in the greatest need should receive the greatest help.

So we will lower the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and double the child tax credit.

Now is the time to reform the tax code and share some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills.

The world needs America's strength and leadership, and America's armed forces need better equipment, better training, and better pay.

We will give our military the means to keep the peace, and we will give it one thing more... a commander-in-chief who respects our men and women in uniform, and a commander-in-chief who earns their respect.

A generation shaped by Vietnam must remember the lessons of Vietnam.

When America uses force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear, and the victory must be overwhelming.

I will work to reduce nuclear weapons and nuclear tension in the world -- to turn these years of influence into decades of peace.

And, at the earliest possible date, my administration will deploy missile defenses to guard against attack and blackmail.

Now is the time, not to defend outdated treaties, but to defend the American people.

A time of prosperity is a test of vision. And our nation today needs vision. That is a fact... or as my opponent might call it, a ""risky truth scheme."" Every one of the proposals I've talked about tonight, he has called a ""risky scheme,"" over and over again.

It is the sum of his message -- the politics of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.

If my opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would have been a ""risky rocket scheme.""

If he'd been there when Edison was testing the light bulb, it would have been a ""risky anti-candle scheme.""

And if he'd been there when the Internet was invented well... I understand he actually was there for that.

He now leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But the only thing he has to offer is fear itself.

That outlook is typical of many in Washington -- always seeing the tunnel at the end of the light.

But I come from a different place, and it has made me a different leader. In Midland, Texas, where I grew up, the town motto was ""the sky is the limit""... and we believed it.

There was a restless energy, a basic conviction that, with hard work, anybody could succeed, and everybody deserved a chance.

Our sense of community was just as strong as that sense of promise.

Neighbors helped each other. There were dry wells and sandstorms to keep you humble, and lifelong friends to take your side, and churches to remind us that every soul is equal in value and equal in need.

This background leaves more than an accent, it leaves an outlook.

Optimistic. Impatient with pretense. Confident that people can chart their own course.

That background may lack the polish of Washington. Then again, I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington.

I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.

The largest lesson I learned in Midland still guides me as governor... Everyone, from immigrant to entrepreneur, has an equal claim on this country's promise.

So we improved our schools, dramatically, for children of every accent, of every background.

We moved people from welfare to work.

We strengthened our juvenile justice laws.

Our budgets have been balanced, with surpluses, and we cut taxes not only once, but twice.

We accomplished a lot.

I don't deserve all the credit, and don't attempt to take it. I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get things done.

A bittersweet part of tonight is that someone is missing, the late Lt. Governor of Texas Bob Bullock.

Bob was a Democrat, a crusty veteran of Texas politics, and my great friend.

He worked by my side, endorsed my re-election, and I know he is with me in spirit in saying to those who would malign our state for political gain... Don't mess with Texas.

As governor, I've made difficult decisions, and stood by them under pressure. I've been where the buck stops -- in business and in government. I've been a chief executive who sets an agenda, sets big goals, and rallies people to believe and achieve them.

I am proud of this record, and I'm prepared for the work ahead.

If you give me your trust, I will honor it... Grant me a mandate, and I will use it... Give me the opportunity to lead this nation, and I will lead...

And we need a leader to seize the opportunities of this new century -- the new cures of medicine, the amazing technologies that will drive our economy and keep the peace.

But our new economy must never forget the old, unfinished struggle for human dignity.

And here we face a challenge to the very heart and founding premise of our nation.

A couple of years ago, I visited a juvenile jail in Marlin, Texas, and talked with a group of young inmates. They were angry, wary kids. All had committed grownup crimes.

Yet when I looked in their eyes, I realized some of them were still little boys.

Toward the end of conversation, one young man, about 15, raised his hand and asked a haunting question... ""What do you think of me?""

He seemed to be asking, like many Americans who struggle... ""Is there hope for me? Do I have a chance?"" And, frankly... ""Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what happens to me?""

A small voice, but it speaks for so many. Single moms struggling to feed the kids and pay the rent. Immigrants starting a hard life in a new world. Children without fathers in neighborhoods where gangs seem like friendship, where drugs promise peace, and where sex, sadly, seems like the closest thing to belonging. We are their country, too.

And each of us must share in its promise, or that promise is diminished for all.

If that boy in Marlin believes he is trapped and worthless and hopeless -- if he believes his life has no value, then other lives have no value to him -- and we are ALL diminished.

When these problems aren't confronted, it builds a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth and technology, education and ambition.

On the other side of the wall are poverty and prison, addiction and despair.

And, my fellow Americans, we must tear down that wall.

Big government is not the answer. But the alternative to bureaucracy is not indifference.

It is to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity.

This is what I mean by compassionate conservatism. And on this ground we will govern our nation.

We will give low-income Americans tax credits to buy the private health insurance they need and deserve.

We will transform today's housing rental program to help hundreds of thousands of low-income families find stability and dignity in a home of their own.

And, in the next bold step of welfare reform, we will support the heroic work of homeless shelters and hospices, food pantries and crisis pregnancy centers -- people reclaiming their communities block-by-block and heart-by-heart.

I think of Mary Jo Copeland, whose ministry called ""Sharing and Caring Hands"" serves 1,000 meals a week in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Each day, Mary Jo washes the feet of the homeless, then sends them off with new socks and shoes.

""Look after your feet,"" she tells them...... ""They must carry you a long way in this world, and then all the way to God.""

Government cannot do this work. It can feed the body, but it cannot reach the soul. Yet government can take the side of these groups, helping the helper, encouraging the inspired.

My administration will give taxpayers new incentives to donate to charity, encourage after-school programs that build character, and support mentoring groups that shape and save young lives.

We must give our children a spirit of moral courage, because their character is our destiny.

We must tell them, with clarity and confidence, that drugs and alcohol can destroy you, and bigotry disfigures the heart.

Our schools must support the ideals of parents, elevating character and abstinence from afterthoughts to urgent goals.

We must help protect our children, in our schools and streets, by finally and strictly enforcing our nation's gun laws.

Most of all, we must teach our children the values that defeat violence. I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life -- the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young, and the life of the unborn. I know good people disagree on this issue, but surely we can agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption and parental notification, and when Congress sends me a bill against partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law.

Behind every goal I have talked about tonight is a great hope for our country.

A hundred years from now, this must not be remembered as an age rich in possessions and poor in ideals.

Instead, we must usher in an era of responsibility.

My generation tested limits -- and our country, in some ways, is better for it.

Women are now treated more equally. Racial progress has been steady, if still too slow. We are learning to protect the natural world around us. We will continue this progress, and we will not turn back.

At times, we lost our way. But we are coming home.

So many of us held our first child, and saw a better self reflected in her eyes.

And in that family love, many have found the sign and symbol of an even greater love, and have been touched by faith.

We have discovered that who we are is more important than what we have. And we know we must renew our values to restore our country.

This is the vision of America's founders.

They never saw our nation's greatness in rising wealth or advancing armies, but in small, unnumbered acts of caring and courage and self-denial.

Their highest hope, as Robert Frost described it, was ""to occupy the land with character.""

And that, 13 generations later, is still our goal... to occupy the land with character.

In a responsibility era, each of us has important tasks -- work that only we can do.

Each of us is responsible... to love and guide our children, and help a neighbor in need.

Synagogues, churches and mosques are responsible... not only to worship but to serve.

Corporations are responsible... to treat their workers fairly, and leave the air and waters clean.

Our nation's leaders are responsible... to confront problems, not pass them on to others.

And to lead this nation to a responsibility era, a president himself must be responsible.

And so, when I put my hand on the Bible, I will swear to not only uphold the laws of our land, I will swear to uphold the honor and dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help me God.

I believe the presidency -- the final point of decision in the American government -- was made for great purposes.

It is the office of Lincoln's conscience and Teddy Roosevelt's energy and Harry Truman's integrity and Ronald Reagan's optimism.

For me, gaining this office is not the ambition of a lifetime, but it IS the opportunity of a lifetime.

And I will make the most of it. I believe great decisions are made with care, made with conviction, not made with polls.

I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn. I am not running in borrowed clothes. When I act, you will know my reasons...When I speak, you will know my heart.

I believe in tolerance, not in spite of my faith, but because of it.

I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our neighbors, but to love them.

I believe in grace, because I have seen it... In peace, because I have felt it... In forgiveness, because I have needed it.

I believe true leadership is a process of addition, not an act of division. I will not attack a part of this country, because I want to lead the whole of it.

And I believe this will be a tough race, down to the wire.

Their war room is up and running... but we are ready. Their attacks will be relentless... but they will be answered. We are facing something familiar, but they are facing something new.

We are now the party of ideas and innovation... The party of idealism and inclusion.

The party of a simple and powerful hope...

My fellow citizens, we can begin again. After all of the shouting, and all of the scandal. After all of the bitterness and broken faith. We can begin again.

The wait has been long, but it won't be long now.

A prosperous nation is ready to renew its purpose and unite behind great goals... and it won't be long now.

Our nation must renew the hopes of that boy I talked with in jail, and so many like him... and it won't be long now.

Our country is ready for high standards and new leaders... and it won't be long now.

An era of tarnished ideals is giving way to a responsibility era... and it won't be long now.

I know how serious the task is before me.

I know the presidency is an office that turns pride into prayer.

But I am eager to start on the work ahead.

And I believe America is ready for a new beginning.

My friend, the artist Tom Lea of El Paso, captured the way I feel about our great land.

He and his wife, he said, ""live on the east side of the mountain...

It is the sunrise side, not the sunset side.

It is the side to see the day that is coming... not the side to see the day that is gone.""

Americans live on the sunrise side of mountain.

The night is passing.

And we are ready for the day to come.

Thank you. And God bless you.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9998572468757629,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

Bob McDonnell. He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy. Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute. It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.

For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students. It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders. VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands. Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way. May God bless all who serve, and all who have served.

Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall—the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war.

General Marshall once said, ""The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it."" Those words were true in his time—and they still echo in ours.

Last month, our nation was attacked again. A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead—murdered in Benghazi, Libya. Among the dead were three veterans. All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both. President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America. And he is right. We all mourn their loss.

The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting ""Death to America."" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.

As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do. These are the right questions. And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events—and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.

The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East—a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.

The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.

We saw all of this in Benghazi last month—but we also saw something else, something hopeful. After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people. They waved signs that read, ""The Ambassador was Libya's friend"" and ""Libya is sorry."" They chanted ""No to militias."" They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound. Then they burned it to the ground. As one Libyan woman said, ""We are not going to go from darkness to darkness.""

This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. It is the struggle of millions and millions of people—men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers—all of whom have had enough of the darkness. It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making. It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria. In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.

We have seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to George Marshall. In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism. Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts.

Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world. We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets. We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies. We led. And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century.

This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country—it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership—a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best. And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.

I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out—no one else. But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history—not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.

The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put ""daylight"" between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.

Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability. It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us. And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital. And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, ""Are you with us, or are you with them?""—the American President was silent.

Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.

In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried—and failed—to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.

The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight. Our ally Turkey has been attacked. And the conflict threatens stability in the region.

America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East.

The President is fond of saying that ""The tide of war is receding."" And I want to believe him as much as anyone. But when we look at the Middle East today—with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates— it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office.

I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.

The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East—friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us. Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, ""We will not forget that you forgot about us.""

It is time to change course in the Middle East. That course should be organized around these bedrock principles: America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them... no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them... and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words.

I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region—and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions—not just words—that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.

I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security—the world must never see any daylight between our two nations.

I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.

And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure. The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow. The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war.

The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines. I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark.

I will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results. I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs. And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government—to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities... to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary... and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property.

I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years. I will reverse that failure. I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones.

I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies.

In Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.

In Egypt, I will use our influence—including clear conditions on our aid—to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid.

In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran—rather than sitting on the sidelines. It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.

And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war — and to potential attacks here at home — is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation.

Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.

There is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East—and it is not unique to that region. It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well— in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are ""pivoting"" away from them... in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region... and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security. But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked: ""Where does America stand?""

I know many Americans are asking a different question: ""Why us?"" I know many Americans are asking whether our country today—with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war—is still capable of leading.

I believe that if America does not lead, others will—others who do not share our interests and our values—and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years. I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence—wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively—to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better—not perfect, but better.

Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership. They want more—more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies. So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind. So many people still have faith in America. We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves—that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events.

Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall: ""He... always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion."" That is the role our friends want America to play again. And it is the role we must play.

The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.

The torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty — and honor — to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light.

Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.",0.11653171479701996,0.33194199204444885,0.3820580542087555,0.0,0.018463414162397385,0.0,0.1509440839290619,Mainstream

Tonight, I have a privilege given few Americans — the privilege of accepting our party's nomination for President of the United States. And I accept it with gratitude, humility and confidence.

In my life, no success has come without a good fight, and this nomination wasn't any different. That's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters. They're leaders of great ability, who love our country, and wished to lead it to better days. Their support is an honor I won't forget.

I'm grateful to the President for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on American soil in our history, and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable; and to the First Lady, Laura Bush, a model of grace and kindness in public and in private. And I'm grateful to the 41st President and his bride of 63 years, and for their outstanding example of honorable service to our country.

As always, I'm indebted to my wife, Cindy, and my seven children. The pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation's business. But I have treasured them all the more, and can't imagine a life without the happiness you give me. Cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight. But, in truth, she's more my inspiration than I am hers. Her concern for those less blessed than we are — victims of land mines, children born in poverty and with birth defects — shows the measure of her humanity. I know she will make a great First Lady.

When I was growing up, my father was often at sea, and the job of raising my brother, sister and me would fall to my mother alone. Roberta McCain gave us her love of life, her deep interest in the world, her strength, and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country. I wouldn't be here tonight but for the strength of her character.

My heartfelt thanks to all of you, who helped me win this nomination, and stood by me when the odds were long. I won't let you down. To Americans who have yet to decide who to vote for, thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust. I intend to earn it.

Finally, a word to Senator Obama and his supporters. We'll go at it over the next two months. That's the nature of these contests, and there are big differences between us. But you have my respect and admiration. Despite our differences, much more unites us than divides us. We are fellow Americans, an association that means more to me than any other. We're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights. No country ever had a greater cause than that. And I wouldn't be an American worthy of the name if I didn't honor Senator Obama and his supporters for their achievement.

But let there be no doubt, my friends, we're going to win this election. And after we've won, we're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot, make this government start working for you again, and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace.

These are tough times for many of you. You're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one, and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home. All you ever asked of government is to stand on your side, not in your way. And that's just what I intend to do: stand on your side and fight for your future.

And I've found just the right partner to help me shake up Washington, Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska. She has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment. She's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption. She's balanced a budget, cut taxes, and taken on the special interests. She's reached across the aisle and asked Republicans, Democrats and Independents to serve in her administration. She's the mother of five children. She's helped run a small business, worked with her hands and knows what it's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries.

She knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for. She stands up for what's right, and she doesn't let anyone tell her to sit down. I'm very proud to have introduced our next Vice President to the country. But I can't wait until I introduce her to Washington. And let me offer an advance warning to the old, big spending, do nothing, me first, country second Washington crowd: change is coming.

I'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is Governor Palin. And when we tell you we're going to change Washington, and stop leaving our country's problems for some unluckier generation to fix, you can count on it. We've got a record of doing just that, and the strength, experience, judgment and backbone to keep our word to you.

You know, I've been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum. Sometimes it's meant as a compliment and sometimes it's not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don't work for a party. I don't work for a special interest. I don't work for myself. I work for you.

I've fought corruption, and it didn't matter if the culprits were Democrats or Republicans. They violated their public trust, and had to be held accountable. I've fought big spenders in both parties, who waste your money on things you neither need nor want, while you struggle to buy groceries, fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment. I've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections. I've fought lobbyists who stole from Indian tribes. I fought crooked deals in the Pentagon. I fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers, drug companies and union bosses.

I fought for the right strategy and more troops in Iraq, when it wasn't a popular thing to do. And when the pundits said my campaign was finished, I said I'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war.

Thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general, David Petreaus, and the brave men and women he has the honor to command, that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military, risked a wider war and threatened the security of all Americans.

I don't mind a good fight. For reasons known only to God, I've had quite a few tough ones in my life. But I learned an important lesson along the way. In the end, it matters less that you can fight. What you fight for is the real test.

I fight for Americans. I fight for you. I fight for Bill and Sue Nebe from Farmington Hills, Michigan, who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market. Bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months. Sue works three jobs to help pay the bills.

I fight for Jake and Toni Wimmer of Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Jake works on a loading dock; coaches Little League, and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled. Toni is a schoolteacher, working toward her Master's Degree. They have two sons, the youngest, Luke, has been diagnosed with autism. Their lives should matter to the people they elect to office. They matter to me.

I fight for the family of Matthew Stanley of Wolfboro, New Hampshire, who died serving our country in Iraq. I wear his bracelet and think of him every day. I intend to honor their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to, remains safe from its enemies.

I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party. We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us. We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption. We lost their trust when rather than reform government, both parties made it bigger. We lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil, both parties and Senator Obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies. We lost their trust, when we valued our power over our principles.

We're going to change that. We're going to recover the people's trust by standing up again for the values Americans admire. The party of Lincoln, Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics.

We believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their God-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the Mayflower to the Latina daughter of migrant workers. We're all God's children and we're all Americans.

We believe in low taxes; spending discipline, and open markets. We believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labor.

We believe in a strong defense, work, faith, service, a culture of life, personal responsibility, the rule of law, and judges who dispense justice impartially and don't legislate from the bench. We believe in the values of families, neighborhoods and communities.

We believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of Americans. Government that doesn't make your choices for you, but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself.

I will keep taxes low and cut them where I can. My opponent will raise them. I will open new markets to our goods and services. My opponent will close them. I will cut government spending. He will increase it.

My tax cuts will create jobs. His tax increases will eliminate them. My health care plan will make it easier for more Americans to find and keep good health care insurance. His plan will force small businesses to cut jobs, reduce wages, and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor.

Keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs. Cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help American companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas. Doubling the child tax exemption from $3500 to $7000 will improve the lives of millions of American families. Reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save, spend and invest as you see fit. Opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity.

I know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government hasn't even noticed. Government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s. That's going to change on my watch. My opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy. We're going to help workers who've lost a job that won't come back, find a new one that won't go away.

We will prepare them for the jobs of today. We will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities. For workers in industries that have been hard hit, we'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary, lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage.

Education is the civil rights issue of this century. Equal access to public education has been gained. But what is the value of access to a failing school? We need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition, empower parents with choice, remove barriers to qualified instructors, attract and reward good teachers, and help bad teachers find another line of work.

When a public school fails to meet its obligations to students, parents deserve a choice in the education of their children. And I intend to give it to them. Some may choose a better public school. Some may choose a private one. Many will choose a charter school. But they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity.

Senator Obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies. I want schools to answer to parents and students. And when I'm President, they will.

My fellow Americans, when I'm President, we're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades. We are going to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries that don't like us very much. We will attack the problem on every front. We will produce more energy at home. We will drill new wells offshore, and we'll drill them now. We will build more nuclear power plants. We will develop clean coal technology. We will increase the use of wind, tide, solar and natural gas. We will encourage the development and use of flex fuel, hybrid and electric automobiles.

Senator Obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power. But Americans know better than that. We must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet. It's an ambitious plan, but Americans are ambitious by nature, and we have faced greater challenges. It's time for us to show the world again how Americans lead.

This great national cause will create millions of new jobs, many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity; jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce.

Today, the prospect of a better world remains within our reach. But we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them, as Americans before us did, with confidence, wisdom and resolve.

We have dealt a serious blow to al Qaeda in recent years. But they are not defeated, and they'll strike us again if they can. Iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons. Russia's leaders, rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power, have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power. They invaded a small, democratic neighbor to gain more control over the world's oil supply, intimidate other neighbors, and further their ambitions of reassembling the Russian empire. And the brave people of Georgia need our solidarity and prayers. As President I will work to establish good relations with Russia so we need not fear a return of the Cold War. But we can't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the American people.

We face many threats in this dangerous world, but I'm not afraid of them. I'm prepared for them. I know how the military works, what it can do, what it can do better, and what it should not do. I know how the world works. I know the good and the evil in it. I know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer, safer and more prosperous world, and how to stand up to those who don't. I know how to secure the peace.

When I was five years old, a car pulled up in front of our house. A Navy officer rolled down the window, and shouted at my father that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. I rarely saw my father again for four years. My grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home with me. I hate war. It is terrible beyond imagination.

I'm running for President to keep the country I love safe, and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has. I will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders, and all the tools at our disposal — diplomatic, economic, military and the power of our ideals — to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace.

In America, we change things that need to be changed. Each generation makes its contribution to our greatness. The work that is ours to do is plainly before us. We don't need to search for it.

We need to change the way government does almost everything: from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy; from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network; from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children. All these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy, the information technology revolution and the end of the Cold War. We have to catch up to history, and we have to change the way we do business in Washington.

The constant partisan rancor that stops us from solving these problems isn't a cause, it's a symptom. It's what happens when people go to Washington to work for themselves and not you.

Again and again, I've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed. That's how I will govern as President. I will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again. I have that record and the scars to prove it. Senator Obama does not.

Instead of rejecting good ideas because we didn't think of them first, let's use the best ideas from both sides. Instead of fighting over who gets the credit, let's try sharing it. This amazing country can do anything we put our minds to. I will ask Democrats and Independents to serve with me. And my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability.

We're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us, and I won't care who gets the credit.

I've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years. But I have been her servant first, last and always. And I've never lived a day, in good times or bad, that I didn't thank God for the privilege.

Long ago, something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life. I was blessed by misfortune. I mean that sincerely. I was blessed because I served in the company of heroes, and I witnessed a thousand acts of courage, compassion and love.

On an October morning, in the Gulf of Tonkin, I prepared for my 23rd mission over North Vietnam. I hadn't any worry I wouldn't come back safe and sound. I thought I was tougher than anyone. I was pretty independent then, too. I liked to bend a few rules, and pick a few fights for the fun of it. But I did it for my own pleasure; my own pride. I didn't think there was a cause more important than me.

Then I found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of Hanoi, with two broken arms, a broken leg, and an angry crowd waiting to greet me. I was dumped in a dark cell, and left to die. I didn't feel so tough anymore. When they discovered my father was an admiral, they took me to a hospital. They couldn't set my bones properly, so they just slapped a cast on me. When I didn't get better, and was down to about a hundred pounds, they put me in a cell with two other Americans. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even feed myself. They did it for me. I was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence. Those men saved my life.

I was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me. I knew why. If I went home, they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners. Our Code said we could only go home in the order of our capture, and there were men who had been shot down before me. I thought about it, though. I wasn't in great shape, and I missed everything about America. But I turned it down.

A lot of prisoners had it worse than I did. I'd been mistreated before, but not as badly as others. I always liked to strut a little after I'd been roughed up to show the other guys I was tough enough to take it. But after I turned down their offer, they worked me over harder than they ever had before. For a long time. And they broke me.

When they brought me back to my cell, I was hurt and ashamed, and I didn't know how I could face my fellow prisoners. The good man in the cell next door, my friend, Bob Craner, saved me. Through taps on a wall he told me I had fought as hard as I could. No man can always stand alone. And then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men I had the honor to serve with. Because every day they fought for me.

I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's. I loved it not just for the many comforts of life here. I loved it for its decency; for its faith in the wisdom, justice and goodness of its people. I loved it because it was not just a place, but an idea, a cause worth fighting for. I was never the same again. I wasn't my own man anymore. I was my country's.

I'm not running for president because I think I'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need. My country saved me. My country saved me, and I cannot forget it. And I will fight for her for as long as I draw breath, so help me God.

If you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them. Enlist in our Armed Forces. Become a teacher. Enter the ministry. Run for public office. Feed a hungry child. Teach an illiterate adult to read. Comfort the afflicted. Defend the rights of the oppressed. Our country will be the better, and you will be the happier. Because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself.

I'm going to fight for my cause every day as your President. I'm going to fight to make sure every American has every reason to thank God, as I thank Him: that I'm an American, a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth, and with hard work, strong faith and a little courage, great things are always within our reach. Fight with me. Fight with me.

Fight for what's right for our country.

Fight for the ideals and character of a free people.

Fight for our children's future.

Fight for justice and opportunity for all.

Stand up to defend our country from its enemies.

Stand up for each other; for beautiful, blessed, bountiful America.

Stand up, stand up, stand up and fight. Nothing is inevitable here. We're Americans, and we never give up. We never quit. We never hide from history. We make history.

Thank you, and God Bless you.",0.6775383353233337,0.0,0.2449662983417511,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07200101763010025,Mainstream

My father immediately left for the submarine base where he was stationed. I rarely saw him again for four years. My grandfather, who commanded the fast carrier task force under Admiral Halsey, came home from the war exhausted from the burdens he had borne, and died the next day. In Vietnam, where I formed the closest friendships of my life, some of those friends never came home to the country they loved so well. I detest war. It might not be the worst thing to befall human beings, but it is wretched beyond all description. When nations seek to resolve their differences by force of arms, a million tragedies ensue. The lives of a nation's finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer and die. Commerce is disrupted; economies are damaged; strategic interests shielded by years of patient statecraft are endangered as the exigencies of war and diplomacy conflict. Not the valor with which it is fought nor the nobility of the cause it serves, can glorify war. Whatever gains are secured, it is loss the veteran remembers most keenly. Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes the merciless reality of war. However heady the appeal of a call to arms, however just the cause, we should still shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us.

I am an idealist, and I believe it is possible in our time to make the world we live in another, better, more peaceful place, where our interests and those of our allies are more secure, and American ideals that are transforming the world, the principles of free people and free markets, advance even farther than they have. But I am, from hard experience and the judgment it informs, a realistic idealist. I know we must work very hard and very creatively to build new foundations for a stable and enduring peace. We cannot wish the world to be a better place than it is. We have enemies for whom no attack is too cruel, and no innocent life safe, and who would, if they could, strike us with the world's most terrible weapons. There are states that support them, and which might help them acquire those weapons because they share with terrorists the same animating hatred for the West, and will not be placated by fresh appeals to the better angels of their nature. This is the central threat of our time, and we must understand the implications of our decisions on all manner of regional and global challenges could have for our success in defeating it.

President Harry Truman once said of America, ""God has created us and brought us to our present position of power and strength for some great purpose."" In his time, that purpose was to contain Communism and build the structures of peace and prosperity that could provide safe passage through the Cold War. Now it is our turn. We face a new set of opportunities, and also new dangers. The developments of science and technology have brought us untold prosperity, eradicated disease, and reduced the suffering of millions. We have a chance in our lifetime to raise the world to a new standard of human existence. Yet these same technologies have produced grave new risks, arming a few zealots with the ability to murder millions of innocents, and producing a global industrialization that can in time threaten our planet.

To meet this challenge requires understanding the world we live in, and the central role the United States must play in shaping it for the future. The United States must lead in the 21st century, just as in Truman's day. But leadership today means something different than it did in the years after World War II, when Europe and the other democracies were still recovering from the devastation of war and the United States was the only democratic superpower. Today we are not alone. There is the powerful collective voice of the European Union, and there are the great nations of India and Japan, Australia and Brazil, South Korea and South Africa, Turkey and Israel, to name just a few of the leading democracies. There are also the increasingly powerful nations of China and Russia that wield great influence in the international system.

In such a world, where power of all kinds is more widely and evenly distributed, the United States cannot lead by virtue of its power alone. We must be strong politically, economically, and militarily. But we must also lead by attracting others to our cause, by demonstrating once again the virtues of freedom and democracy, by defending the rules of international civilized society and by creating the new international institutions necessary to advance the peace and freedoms we cherish. Perhaps above all, leadership in today's world means accepting and fulfilling our responsibilities as a great nation.

One of those responsibilities is to be a good and reliable ally to our fellow democracies. We cannot build an enduring peace based on freedom by ourselves, and we do not want to. We have to strengthen our global alliances as the core of a new global compact -- a League of Democracies -- that can harness the vast influence of the more than one hundred democratic nations around the world to advance our values and defend our shared interests.

At the heart of this new compact must be mutual respect and trust. Recall the words of our founders in the Declaration of Independence, that we pay ""decent respect to the opinions of mankind."" Our great power does not mean we can do whatever we want whenever we want, nor should we assume we have all the wisdom and knowledge necessary to succeed. We need to listen to the views and respect the collective will of our democratic allies. When we believe international action is necessary, whether military, economic, or diplomatic, we will try to persuade our friends that we are right. But we, in return, must be willing to be persuaded by them.

America must be a model citizen if we want others to look to us as a model. How we behave at home affects how we are perceived abroad. We must fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundation of our society. We can't torture or treat inhumanely suspected terrorists we have captured. I believe we should close Guantanamo and work with our allies to forge a new international understanding on the disposition of dangerous detainees under our control.

There is such a thing as international good citizenship. We need to be good stewards of our planet and join with other nations to help preserve our common home. The risks of global warming have no borders. We and the other nations of the world must get serious about substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years or we will hand off a much-diminished world to our grandchildren. We need a successor to the Kyoto Treaty, a cap-and-trade system that delivers the necessary environmental impact in an economically responsible manner. We Americans must lead by example and encourage the participation of the rest of the world, including most importantly, the developing economic powerhouses of China and India.

Four and a half decades ago, John Kennedy described the people of Latin America as our ""firm and ancient friends, united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of American civilization."" With globalization, our hemisphere has grown closer, more integrated, and more interdependent. Latin America today is increasingly vital to the fortunes of the United States. Americans north and south share a common geography and a common destiny. The countries of Latin America are the natural partners of the United States, and our northern neighbor Canada.

Relations with our southern neighbors must be governed by mutual respect, not by an imperial impulse or by anti-American demagoguery. The promise of North, Central, and South American life is too great for that. I believe the Americas can and must be the model for a new 21st century relationship between North and South. Ours can be the first completely democratic hemisphere, where trade is free across all borders, where the rule of law and the power of free markets advance the security and prosperity of all.

Power in the world today is moving east; the Asia-Pacific region is on the rise. Together with our democratic partner of many decades, Japan, we can grasp the opportunities present in the unfolding world and this century can become safe -- both American and Asian, both prosperous and free. Asia has made enormous strides in recent decades. Its economic achievements are well known; less known is that more people live under democratic rule in Asia than in any other region of the world.

Dealing with a rising China will be a central challenge for the next American president. Recent prosperity in China has brought more people out of poverty faster than during any other time in human history. China's newfound power implies responsibilities. China could bolster its claim that it is ""peacefully rising"" by being more transparent about its significant military buildup, by working with the world to isolate pariah states such as Burma, Sudan and Zimbabwe, and by ceasing its efforts to establish regional forums and economic arrangements designed to exclude America from Asia.

China and the United States are not destined to be adversaries. We have numerous overlapping interests and hope to see our relationship evolve in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world. But until China moves toward political liberalization, our relationship will be based on periodically shared interests rather than the bedrock of shared values.

The United States did not single-handedly win the Cold War; the transatlantic alliance did, in concert with partners around the world. The bonds we share with Europe in terms of history, values, and interests are unique. Americans should welcome the rise of a strong, confident European Union as we continue to support a strong NATO. The future of the transatlantic relationship lies in confronting the challenges of the twenty-first century worldwide: developing a common energy policy, creating a transatlantic common market tying our economies more closely together, addressing the dangers posed by a revanchist Russia, and institutionalizing our cooperation on issues such as climate change, foreign assistance, and democracy promotion.

We should start by ensuring that the G-8, the group of eight highly industrialized states, becomes again a club of leading market democracies: it should include Brazil and India but exclude Russia. Rather than tolerate Russia's nuclear blackmail or cyber attacks, Western nations should make clear that the solidarity of NATO, from the Baltic to the Black Sea, is indivisible and that the organization's doors remain open to all democracies committed to the defense of freedom.

While Africa's problems -- poverty, corruption, disease, and instability -- are well known, we must refocus on the bright promise offered by many countries on that continent. We must strongly engage on a political, economic, and security level with friendly governments across Africa, but insist on improvements in transparency and the rule of law. Many African nations will not reach their true potential without external assistance to combat entrenched problems, such as HIV/AIDS, that afflict Africans disproportionately. I will establish the goal of eradicating malaria on the continent -- the number one killer of African children under the age of five. In addition to saving millions of lives in the world's poorest regions, such a campaign would do much to add luster to America's image in the world.

We also share an obligation with the world's other great powers to halt and reverse the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United States and the international community must work together and do all in our power to contain and reverse North Korea's nuclear weapons program and to prevent Iran -- a nation whose President has repeatedly expressed a desire to wipe Israel from the face of the earth -- from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We should work to reduce nuclear arsenals all around the world, starting with our own. Forty years ago, the five declared nuclear powers came together in support of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and pledged to end the arms race and move toward nuclear disarmament. The time has come to renew that commitment. We do not need all the weapons currently in our arsenal. The United States should lead a global effort at nuclear disarmament consistent with our vital interests and the cause of peace.

If we are successful in pulling together a global coalition for peace and freedom -- if we lead by shouldering our international responsibilities and pointing the way to a better and safer future for humanity, I believe we will gain tangible benefits as a nation.

It will strengthen us to confront the transcendent challenge of our time: the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. This challenge is transcendent not because it is the only one we face. There are many dangers in today's world, and our foreign policy must be agile and effective at dealing with all of them. But the threat posed by the terrorists is unique. They alone devote all their energies and indeed their very lives to murdering innocent men, women, and children. They alone seek nuclear weapons and other tools of mass destruction not to defend themselves or to enhance their prestige or to give them a stronger hand in world affairs but to use against us wherever and whenever they can. Any president who does not regard this threat as transcending all others does not deserve to sit in the White House, for he or she does not take seriously enough the first and most basic duty a president has -- to protect the lives of the American people.

We learned through the tragic experience of September 11 that passive defense alone cannot protect us. We must protect our borders. But we must also have an aggressive strategy of confronting and rooting out the terrorists wherever they seek to operate, and deny them bases in failed or failing states. Today al Qaeda and other terrorist networks operate across the globe, seeking out opportunities in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa, and in the Middle East.

Prevailing in this struggle will require far more than military force. It will require the use of all elements of our national power: public diplomacy; development assistance; law enforcement training; expansion of economic opportunity; and robust intelligence capabilities. I have called for major changes in how our government faces the challenge of radical Islamic extremism by much greater resources for and integration of civilian efforts to prevent conflict and to address post-conflict challenges. Our goal must be to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the vast majority of moderate Muslims who do not want their future controlled by a minority of violent extremists. In this struggle, scholarships will be far more important than smart bombs.

We also need to build the international structures for a durable peace in which the radical extremists are gradually eclipsed by the more powerful forces of freedom and tolerance. Our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan are critical in this respect and cannot be viewed in isolation from our broader strategy. In the troubled and often dangerous region they occupy, these two nations can either be sources of extremism and instability or they can in time become pillars of stability, tolerance, and democracy.

For decades in the greater Middle East, we had a strategy of relying on autocrats to provide order and stability. We relied on the Shah of Iran, the autocratic rulers of Egypt, the generals of Pakistan, the Saudi royal family, and even, for a time, on Saddam Hussein. In the late 1970s that strategy began to unravel. The Shah was overthrown by the radical Islamic revolution that now rules in Tehran. The ensuing ferment in the Muslim world produced increasing instability. The autocrats clamped down with ever greater repression, while also surreptitiously aiding Islamic radicalism abroad in the hopes that they would not become its victims. It was a toxic and explosive mixture. The oppression of the autocrats blended with the radical Islamists' dogmatic theology to produce a perfect storm of intolerance and hatred.

We can no longer delude ourselves that relying on these out-dated autocracies is the safest bet. They no longer provide lasting stability, only the illusion of it. We must not act rashly or demand change overnight. But neither can we pretend the status quo is sustainable, stable, or in our interests. Change is occurring whether we want it or not. The only question for us is whether we shape this change in ways that benefit humanity or let our enemies seize it for their hateful purposes. We must help expand the power and reach of freedom, using all our many strengths as a free people. This is not just idealism. It is the truest kind of realism. It is the democracies of the world that will provide the pillars upon which we can and must build an enduring peace.

If you look at the great arc that extends from the Middle East through Central Asia and the Asian subcontinent all the way to Southeast Asia, you can see those pillars of democracy stretching across the entire expanse, from Turkey and Israel to India and Indonesia. Iraq and Afghanistan lie at the heart of that region. And whether they eventually become stable democracies themselves, or are allowed to sink back into chaos and extremism, will determine not only the fate of that critical part of the world, but our fate, as well.

That is the broad strategic perspective through which to view our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many people ask, how should we define success? Success in Iraq and Afghanistan is the establishment of peaceful, stable, prosperous, democratic states that pose no threat to neighbors and contribute to the defeat of terrorists. It is the triumph of religious tolerance over violent radicalism.

Those who argue that our goals in Iraq are unachievable are wrong, just as they were wrong a year ago when they declared the war in Iraq already lost. Since June 2007 sectarian and ethnic violence in Iraq has been reduced by 90 percent. Overall civilian deaths have been reduced by more than 70 percent. Deaths of coalition forces have fallen by 70 percent. The dramatic reduction in violence has opened the way for a return to something approaching normal political and economic life for the average Iraqi. People are going back to work. Markets are open. Oil revenues are climbing. Inflation is down. Iraq's economy is expected to grown by roughly 7 percent in 2008. Political reconciliation is occurring across Iraq at the local and provincial grassroots level. Sunni and Shi'a chased from their homes by terrorist and sectarian violence are returning. Political progress at the national level has been far too slow, but there is progress.

Critics say that the ""surge"" of troops isn't a solution in itself, that we must make progress toward Iraqi self-sufficiency. I agree. Iraqis themselves must increasingly take responsibility for their own security, and they must become responsible political actors. It does not follow from this, however, that we should now recklessly retreat from Iraq regardless of the consequences. We must take the course of prudence and responsibility, and help Iraqis move closer to the day when they no longer need our help.

That is the route of responsible statesmanship. We have incurred a moral responsibility in Iraq. It would be an unconscionable act of betrayal, a stain on our character as a great nation, if we were to walk away from the Iraqi people and consign them to the horrendous violence, ethnic cleansing, and possibly genocide that would follow a reckless, irresponsible, and premature withdrawal. Our critics say America needs to repair its image in the world. How can they argue at the same time for the morally reprehensible abandonment of our responsibilities in Iraq?

Those who claim we should withdraw from Iraq in order to fight Al Qaeda more effectively elsewhere are making a dangerous mistake. Whether they were there before is immaterial, al Qaeda is in Iraq now, as it is in the borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Somalia, and in Indonesia. If we withdraw prematurely from Iraq, al Qaeda in Iraq will survive, proclaim victory and continue to provoke sectarian tensions that, while they have been subdued by the success of the surge, still exist, as various factions of Sunni and Shi'a have yet to move beyond their ancient hatreds, and are ripe for provocation by al Qaeda. Civil war in Iraq could easily descend into genocide, and destabilize the entire region as neighboring powers come to the aid of their favored factions. I believe a reckless and premature withdrawal would be a terrible defeat for our security interests and our values. Iran will also view our premature withdrawal as a victory, and the biggest state supporter of terrorists, a country with nuclear ambitions and a stated desire to destroy the State of Israel, will see its influence in the Middle East grow significantly. These consequences of our defeat would threaten us for years, and those who argue for it, as both Democratic candidates do, are arguing for a course that would eventually draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would entail far greater dangers and sacrifices than we have suffered to date. I do not argue against withdrawal, any more than I argued several years ago for the change in tactics and additional forces that are now succeeding in Iraq, because I am somehow indifferent to war and the suffering it inflicts on too many American families. I hold my position because I hate war, and I know very well and very personally how grievous its wages are. But I know, too, that we must sometimes pay those wages to avoid paying even higher ones later.

I run for President because I want to keep the country I love and have served all my life safe, and to rise to the challenges of our times, as generations before us rose to theirs. I run for President because I know it is incumbent on America, more than any other nation on earth, to lead in building the foundations for a stable and enduring peace, a peace built on the strength of our commitment to it, on the transformative ideals on which we were founded, on our ability to see around the corner of history, and on our courage and wisdom to make hard choices. I run because I believe, as strongly as I ever have, that it is within our power to make in our time another, better world than we inherited.

And on behalf of my family, here and gone, I accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the United States of America.
And let me thank Speaker Paul Ryan for that gracious welcome.
Paul, you're a true friend and a great American leader.
But Paul knows me well, and he knows the introduction I prefer is just a little bit shorter: I'm a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.
You know, I'm new to this campaign and honestly I never thought I'd be standing here. I thought I'd be spending this evening with all my friends from the great state of Indiana.
Yet, there I was, a few days ago in New York City with the man who won 37 states, who faced 16 talented opponents and outlasted every one of them and along the way brought millions of new voters into the Republican Party.
You know, he's a man known for a larger personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma. And so, I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket.
Well, for those of you who don't know me, which is most of you......I grew up on the front row of the American dream. My grandfather immigrated to this country. I was raised in a small town in southern Indiana, in a big family with a cornfield in the backyard.
Although we weren't really a political family, the heroes of my youth were President John F. Kennedy and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
When I was young, I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters: a family, a business and a good name. I was raised to believe in hard work, in faith and family. My dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea.
Dad ran gas stations in our small town and he was a great father. If Dad were with us today, I have a feeling he'd enjoy this moment and probably be pretty surprised.
But it's such a joy for me to tell you that my mother is here. Would you join me in welcoming the light of my life, my mom, Nancy.
You know, growing up I actually started in politics in the other party until I heard the voice and the ideals of the 40th president and I said on for the Reagan revolution.
But the best thing that ever happened to me, even counting tonight, was that 31 years ago I married the girl of my dreams, a school teacher and artist. She is everything to me. Would you welcome my wonderful wife, Karen Pence.
And regardless of any title I'll ever hold, the most important job I'll ever have is spelled D-A-D.
Karen and I are blessed. Karen and I are blessed to be the parents of the three greatest kids in the world: a writer named Charlotte, a college student named Audrey and a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps Michael J. Pence.
I'm so proud of you guys.
Now, if you know anything about Hoosiers, you know we love to suit up and compete. We play to win. That's why I joined this campaign in a heartbeat. You have nominated a man for president who never quits, who never backs down, a fighter, a winner. Until now, he's had to do it all by himself against all odds, but this week, with this united party, he's got backup. And on November 8th, I know we will elect Donald Trump to be the 45th president of the United States of America!
Now, we'll win because we're running on the issues facing this country and because we're leveling with the American people about the stakes and the choice.
You know, the American people are tired of being told. They're tired of being told that this is as good as it gets. They're tired of hearing politicians in both parties tell us that we'll get to that tomorrow while we pile a mountain range of debt on our children and our grandchildren.
And as Ronald Reagan used to say, they're tired of being told that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives better for us than we can plan them for ourselves.
In the end, this election comes down to just two names on the ballot, so let's resolve here and now that Hillary Clinton will never become president of the United States of America.
Now, Hillary Clinton essentially offers a third Obama term. And the role is perfect for her. She championed ""Obamacare"" because years earlier she had all but invented it. The national debt has nearly doubled in these eight years and her only answer is to keep borrowing and spending. And like the president, she thinks the path to a growing economy is more taxes, more regulation and more government.
Now, they tell us this economy is the best that we can do. It's nowhere near the best that we could do, it's just the best that they can do.
Now, let me tell you, I know firsthand it doesn't have to be like this. In my home state of Indiana we prove every day that you can build a growing economy on balanced budgets, low taxes, even while making record investments in education and roads and health care.
You know, Indiana is a state that works because conservative principles work every time you put them into practice.
Now, today, while the nation suffers under the weight of $19 trillion in a national debt, we in Indiana have a $2 billion surplus, the highest credit rating in the nation, even though we've cut taxes every year since I became governor four years ago.
We have fewer state employees than when I took office, and businesses large and small have created nearly 150,000 new jobs, and there's more Hoosiers going to work than ever before. That's what you can do with common sense Republican leadership and that's exactly what the no-nonsense leadership of Donald Trump will bring to the White House.
You know, Donald Trump gets it, he's the genuine article. He's a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers. And when Donald Trump does his talking, he doesn't tiptoe around the thousand new rules of political correctness.
He's his own man, distinctly American. And where else would an independent spirit like his find a following than in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
The funny thing is...
You know, the funny thing is the party in power seems helpless to figure out our nominee. The media has the same problem.
They all keep telling each other that the usual methods will work against him. They keep thinking they've done him in, only to wake up the next morning and find that Donald Trump is still standing and running stronger than ever before. The man just doesn't quit.
He's tough. He perseveres. He's gone about as far as you can go in business, but he's never turned his back on the working men and women who make this country grow.
And Donald Trump will never turn his back on those who serve and protect us at home and abroad.
You know, it's been a heartbreaking time for the women and men in our law enforcement community. And in this time of great testing for them, let's let them know here and now, all across this country, we will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line of law enforcement in America.
Now, you know, while Donald Trump was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself. I've seen the way he deals with people who work for him at every level. And I've seen the way they feel about working for him.
Now, I'll grant you he can be a little rough with politicians on the stage, and I'll be we see that again.
But I've seen this good man up close, his utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him and his devotion to his family.
And if you still doubt what I'm saying, remember, as we say back home, you can't fake good kids. How about his amazing children, aren't they something?
These are the true measures of our nominee, chosen by the voters as the right man for these times. This is the outsider, my running mate, who turned a long-shot campaign into a movement.
Now, over in the other party, you know, if the idea was to present the exact opposite of a political outsider, the exact opposite of an uncalculating truth-teller, then on that score you've got to hand it to the Democratic establishment, they outdid themselves this time!
I mean, at the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names. People in both parties are restless for change, ready to break free of old patterns in Washington. And Democrats are about to anoint someone who represents everything this country is tired of.
You know, Hillary Clinton wants a better title and I would, too, if I was already America's secretary of the status quo.
You know, the choice couldn't be more clear. Americans can elect someone who literally personifies the failed establishment in Washington, D.C. or we can choose a leader who will fight every day to make America great again. It's change versus status quo. And my fellow Republicans, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, the change will be huge.
You know, for years we've had fundamental problems in America that get talked to death in Washington, D.C., but they never get solved and they even get worse. We've seen entire stretches of our country written off by bad economic policies in ways that are deeply unfair to American workers. We've seen relentless mandates from the executive branch. It seems like no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise and no provision of the Constitution is too large for them to ignore.
Meanwhile, we've seen borders that go unrespected, a military that's been diminished, and promise after ringing promise to our veterans, promptly forgotten.
Then Donald Trump came along and started saying what practically everybody was thinking anyway, that our leaders need to be stronger. Under Donald Trump, our deals will be smarter, our soldiers will have what they need and our veterans will have what they earned. We will secure our borders, protect our nation. In all this, we will be more serious. And when we do, this nation will start winning again.
You know, that's the message that men and women in both parties have been longing to hear. But none of us should think for one second that this will be easy. The outcome of this election depends on us and how we contend with an incredible onslaught that's coming our way.
You know, this won't be America's first glimpse of the Clinton machine in action, as Bernie Sanders can tell you.
And this time around, she'll have the press doing half her work for her.
The good news is it won't be nearly enough, not against a candidate who's captured the attention of the country the way Donald Trump has.
On issue by issue, he and I will take our case to the voters, pointing out the failures of the Obama/Clinton agenda and showing a better way. We will win the hearts and minds of the American people with an agenda for a stronger and more prosperous America.
Now, the establishment in Washington, D.C. thinks it's only a narrow range of voters who are giving Donald Trump a serious look. But I can tell you firsthand there's a lot of Americans out there who feel like Democrat politicians have taken them for granted.
It's union members who don't want a president who promises to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.
Those miners want an American energy policy and they know that Donald Trump digs coal.
It's African Americans, who remember generations of hollow promises about safe streets and better schools, and they know Donald Trump will fight for equal opportunity. And he loves educational choice.
And it's Hispanic Americans, who respect the law, want jobs and opportunities for their families, who know that Donald Trump will uphold the law and get this economy moving for every American.
You know, the party of Lincoln was founded on equality of opportunity. And during these difficult days, it will be our party and our agenda that opens the doors for every American to succeed and prosper in this land.
You know, in so many ways the Democratic Party has abandoned those it used to protect. Maybe they've become too entrenched in power, so comfortable at times that they lose patience with the normal legislative process. It's so much simpler to impose their values by executive order or court action. And make no mistake about it, Hillary Clinton has some big ideas along those lines, too.
As this election approaches, every American should know that while we're filling the presidency for the next four years, this election will define the Supreme Court for the next 40.
We all better think very carefully — very carefully — about what this means for our Constitution and limited government. Elect Hillary Clinton and you better get used to being subject to unelected judges using unaccountable power to take unconstitutional actions.
So let me say, for the sake of the rule of law, for the sake of the sanctity of life, for the sake of our Second Amendment and for the sake of all our other God-given liberties, we must ensure that the next president appointing justices to the Supreme Court is Donald Trump.
And Hillary Clinton's record on foreign affairs gets even worse. You know, it was Hillary Clinton who helped undo all the gains of the troop surge, a staggering failure of judgment that set ISIS on the loose.
It was Hillary Clinton who instigated the president's disastrous agreement with the radical mullahs in Iran. And it was Hillary Clinton who left Americans in harm's way in Benghazi and after four Americans fell said, what difference at this point does it make?
As the proud father of a United States Marine, let me say from my heart, anyone who said that, anyone who did that should be disqualified from ever serving as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States of America!
Seven-and-a-half years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's policies have weakened America's place in the world. Terrorist attacks at home and abroad, grim and heartbreaking scenes from France just a few short days ago, and the attempted coup in Turkey all attest to a world spinning apart.
History teaches us that weakness arouses evil. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy of leading from behind, moving red lines, feigning resets with Russia, and the rise, rule and reign of ISIS are a testament to this truth of history. We cannot have four more years apologizing to our enemies and abandoning our friends.
America needs to be strong for the world to be safe, and on the world stage Donald Trump will lead from strength.
Donald Trump will rebuild our military and stand with our allies. Donald Trump will confront radical Islamic terrorism at its source and destroy the enemies of our freedom.
And if the world knows nothing else, it will know this: America stands with Israel!
You know, if you looked at the calendar this morning you might have noticed the presidency of Barack Obama ends exactly six months from today.
And this much is certain, this much is certain of the Obama years. They're not ending well. There seems to be so many things that divide us and so few great purposes that unite us as they once did. And it's at moments like this, moments when politics fail, that I believe we'd do well to remember that what unites us far exceeds anything that sets us apart in America.
That we are, as we have always been, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
Should I have the awesome privilege to serve as your vice president, I promise to keep faith with that conviction, to pray daily for a wise and discerning heart, for who is able to govern this great people of yours without it.
My fellow Americans, I believe we have come to another rendezvous with destiny. And I have faith, faith in the boundless capacity of the American people and faith that God can still heal our land.
But we have a choice to make. This is another time for choosing. If you want a president who will protect this nation, confront radical Islamic terrorism and rid the world of ISIS, if you want a president who will restore law and order to this country and give law enforcement the support and resources they deserve, if you want a president who will cut taxes, grow our economy and squeeze every nickel out of the federal bureaucracy......if you want a president who will build strong borders and enforce our laws, and if you want a president who will upend the status quo in Washington, D.C. and appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution......we have but one choice and that man is ready, this team is ready, our party is ready. And when we elect Donald Trump the 45th president of the United States, together we will make America great again!
Thank you, and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America!",0.0,0.0,0.05642424151301384,0.5404660701751709,0.1269708126783371,0.0,0.2760557532310486,Mainstream
USA_POP_01,US,Populist,Donald Trump,21/07/2016,Acceptance speech,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-cleveland,5047,Acceptance,Y,Y,trumpacceptance.txt,trumpacceptance_cleaned.txt,Donald Trump accepting the RNC 2016,"Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.

So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.

And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs.

They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen.

Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.

When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.

When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.

The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.

Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.

It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably— probably— from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.

Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.

They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.

So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19— and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said— and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, ""Don't hit Iraq,"" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.

We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.

And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.

Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees— these are big vehicles— were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.

Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product— a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.

Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.

And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.

That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.

But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.

Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.

It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, ""That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.""

We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.

Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.

And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website.

I have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website.

Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us— believe me— to the promised land. They will not.

As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know— ""Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?""

I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.

But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.

I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, ""What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.""

And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to— I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine.

In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.

But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, ""Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.""

We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be— and— and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.

So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully— they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.

Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.

Now, our country needs— our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote ""The Art of the Deal.""

We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.

And we also need a cheerleader.

You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, ""Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.""

He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.

He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.

But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.

We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again.

We need— we need somebody— we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.

And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, ""Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.""

You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.

So ladies and gentlemen...I am officially running... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.

It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.

We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be— they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.

I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.

I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.

Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.

How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?

I'm going to tell you— thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.

Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.

He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.

We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.

Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...

So we need people— I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.

Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.

So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.

But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything— everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.

So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, ""What's your problem?""

He said, ""You know, I make great product.""

And I said, ""I know. I know that because I buy the product.""

He said, ""I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.""

I said, ""Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?""

He said, ""Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.""

I said, ""They send it back?""

""Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.""

Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.

Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.

Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for— I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.

I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, ""Oh, you don't like China?""

No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much— it's like— it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.

They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.

We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.

Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country— we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.

They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.

And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.

So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, ""That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it.""

But I have another one, Ford.

So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.

All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.

Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.

So I announced that I'm running for president. I would...... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in— and I wouldn't even use— you know, I have— I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.

You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they're not good.

But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.

But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, ""Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.""

And you say to yourself, ""How does that help us,"" right? ""How does that help us? Where is that good""? It's not.

So I would say, ""Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.

Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're (inaudible). And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, ""You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.""

And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.

So under President Trump, here's what would happen:

The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.

And he'll say, ""Please, please, please."" He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, ""No interest."" Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, ""Sorry, fellas. No interest,"" because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.

I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I (inaudible).

And by the way, I'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.

So— because we got to make the country rich.

It sounds crass. Somebody said, ""Oh, that's crass."" It's not crass.

We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.

We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.

We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.

But here's what's going to happen:

After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the— the donors and by the lobbyists— and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero— I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. ""Please reconsider,"" I'll say no.

He'll say, ""Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."" That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.

There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.

Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say ""we're gonna protect."" What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.

If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.

And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out— and they kept our equipment.

They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be— we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.

But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.

And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now— it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running.

But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, ""Is he intelligent?""

Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.

How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna— how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.

But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.

There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.

So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.

Somebody said — thank you, darlin'.

Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.""

That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family.

By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?

Great. Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family.

So the reporter said to me the other day, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?""

I said, ""I don't know."" I said, ""I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.""

But, I said, ""This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, ""He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.""

They're right about that, but I'm doing it.

Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.

So I said, ""That's OK."" I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.

I started off— thank you— I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.

But he used to say, ""Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.""

I said, ""I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.""

And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals— the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.

But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, ""Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.""

So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am.

I've employed— I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.

So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't [use] extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything.

And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, ""He had assets of $9 billion."" So I said, ""No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.""

So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.

It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.

And I have assets— big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected— 9 billion 240 million dollars.

And I have liabilities of about $500 million. That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.

In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, ""Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion""? I said, ""I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.""

But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of—net worth, not assets, not— a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets— Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York— many other places all over the world.

So the total is $8,737,540,00.

Now I'm not doing that...

I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.

I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.

We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.

So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years— you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.

According to the economists— who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying— that $24 trillion— we're very close— that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.

So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.

I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.

Mark my words.

Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.

I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.

I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.

I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.

Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.

Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump,"" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened""— it's up in the prison area— ""my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.""

I said, ""Very interesting.""

So protect the Second Amendment.

End— end Common Core. Common Core should— it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end education has to be local.

Rebuild the country's infrastructure.

Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.

I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.

You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after— or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.

Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.

So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.

You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.

Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.

Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.

Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.

Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.

Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.

And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.

Sadly, the American dream is dead.

But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.

Thank you. Thank you very much.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9998955726623535,Populist

Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.

Thank you very much.

Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.

The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.

Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?

This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.

I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.

And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.

We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.

We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.

This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.

But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.

Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.

Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.

Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.

Thank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.

These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.

Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.

Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.

This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.

He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.

Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.

He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.

Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.

Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.

In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.

A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.

On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.

And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.

While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.

And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.

But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.

Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.

The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.

Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.

Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.

But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.

Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.

To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.

Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.

No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.

We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.

Thank you.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.

President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.

Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.

On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.

Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.

This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?

Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --

And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.

While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.

I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.

Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?

We will build a great wall along the southern border.

And Mexico will pay for the wall.

One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.

We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.

Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.

Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.

Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.

And they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.

Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?

Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.

Zero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.

According to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.

Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.

They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.

And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.

Beyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.

They're going out. They're going out fast.

Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.

We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.

That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.

Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.

My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.

Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.

This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.

Here's an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.

On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.

To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.

And then we get them out.

Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.

The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.

We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.

Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?

Maybe they'll be able to deport her.

The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.

We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.

And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.

I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.

And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.

Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.

We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.

Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.

We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.

And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.

Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.

Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.

And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.

And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.

Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.

Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.

Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.

Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.

Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.

According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.

Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.

The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.

Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.

I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.

And if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.

For the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.

But we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.

Another reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.

Thank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.

That's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.

Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.

There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.

Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.

And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.

Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.

In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.

The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.

According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.

We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.

These 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.

And, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.

(APPLAUSE)

Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.

The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.

Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.

Hillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.

Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.

Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.

And, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?

Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.

If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.

We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.

Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.

We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.

Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.

That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.

And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.

Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.

Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.

And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.

We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.

We're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.

We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.

We've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.

Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.

To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.

We take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.

You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.

To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.

And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.

She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.

You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.

To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?

So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.

I will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.

And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.

For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --

Thank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.

We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.

Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.

This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.

Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.

And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.

That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.

Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.

Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.

These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.

She didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.

She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.

What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.

The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.

This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.

It's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.

So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.

I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.

These are amazing people.

(Family members speak individually.)

Thank you.

These are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.

That's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.

So, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.

Let's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.

Let's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.

This has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.

We're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.

Thank you.

Thank you.

This is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.

Together we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.

Thank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.",0.012715626507997513,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9872226715087891,Populist

In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.

Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.

There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.

The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.

The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.

For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.

This is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.

The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago - and yet they are working harder.

It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.

Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan - and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.

The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.

And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.

With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before - and we won't let them do that.

The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.

For them, it is a war - and for them, nothing is out of bounds.

This is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.

This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.

The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.

The Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.

People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.

And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.

It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine - including 2,000 more emails this morning

These claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false - and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.

We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.

What's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine - and that magazine should be put out of business.

Six months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.

We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it - just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.

That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago - another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.

Also, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election.

This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony - the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.

This weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.

This is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.

I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.

But let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime - indeed one the most important elections in modern history - and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.

So now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed - in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.

When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.

I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.

But I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.

Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.

We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.

But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.

Their financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.

Our political establishment has no soul.

I knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.

The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.

They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States - in the back of her airplane, while on the runway - for 39 minutes - to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.

Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more - and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.

This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.

This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.

I didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.

Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.

In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else - and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right - and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.

The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future - but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.

If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person - which is what our country needs - will ever again run for this office.

I will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.

What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.

But I also know, it's not about me - it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country.

It's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.

This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.

This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.

We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.

We will vote for the country we want.

We will vote for the future we want.

We will vote for the politics we want.

We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country - and the disenfranchisement of our people.

Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9997708797454834,0.0,Populist

Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.
So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this.
And, I can tell you, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs.
They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen.
Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.
When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time.
When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically.
The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems.
Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.
But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people.
It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast.
Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them.
They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken.
So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, ""Don't hit Iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil."" And it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league.
We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands--in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.
And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.
Last week, I read: 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
You're right.
Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.
Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.
And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it.
That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.
But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense.
Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the day, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work.
It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, ""That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.""
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.
Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster.
And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion Web site.
I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site.
Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not.
As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know — ""Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?""
I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us.
But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.
Thank you.
I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, ""What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job.""
And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine.
In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.
But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, ""Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.""
We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.
So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully — they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.
Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? It won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.
Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote ""The Art of the Deal.""
We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.
And we also need a cheerleader.
You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, ""Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit.""
He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.
He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that.
But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite.
We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again.
We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.
And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, ""Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough.""
You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.
So ladies and gentlemen...
I am officially running... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.
It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.
We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be — they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.
I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.
I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money.
Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better.
How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?
I'm going to tell you — thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.
Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator.
He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.
We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have.
Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...
So we need people — I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.
Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work.
So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.
But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete.
So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, ""What's your problem?""
He said, ""You know, I make great product.""
And I said, ""I know. I know that because I buy the product.""
He said, ""I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.""
I said, ""Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this?""
He said, ""Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.""
I said, ""They send it back?""
""Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them.""
Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.
Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.
Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.
I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, ""Oh, you don't like China?""
No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much — it's like — it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders.
They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place.
We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.
Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.
They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.
And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.
So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, ""That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it.""
But I have another one, Ford.
So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.
All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.
Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.
So I announced that I'm running for president. I would...... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn't even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.
You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they're not good.
But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.
But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, ""Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.""
And you say to yourself, ""How does that help us,"" right? ""How does that help us? Where is that good""? It's not.
So I would say, ""Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it.
Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, ""You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford.""
And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us.
So under President Trump, here's what would happen:
The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.
And he'll say, ""Please, please, please."" He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, ""No interest."" Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, ""Sorry, fellas. No interest,"" because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money.
I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I
And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a — that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.
So — because we got to make the country rich.
It sounds crass. Somebody said, ""Oh, that's crass."" It's not crass.
We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.
We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.
We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.
But here's what's going to happen:
After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. ""Please reconsider,"" I'll say no.
He'll say, ""Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico."" That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice.
There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example.
Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say ""we're gonna protect."" What are we doing? They've got nothing but money.
If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us.
And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.
They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.
But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone.
And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now — it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running.
But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, ""Is he intelligent?""
Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question.
How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible.
But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.
There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.
So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence.
Somebody said — thank you, darlin'.
Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person.""
That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family.
By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?
Great. Jared (ph), Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family.
So the reporter said to me the other day, ""But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?""
I said, ""I don't know."" I said, ""I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person.""
But, I said, ""This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, ""He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle.""
They're right about that, but I'm doing it.
Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.
So I said, ""That's OK."" I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job.
I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.
But he used to say, ""Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it.""
I said, ""I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it.""
And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing.
But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, ""Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks.""
So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am.
I've employed — I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.
So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything.
And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, ""He had assets of $9 billion."" So I said (ph), ""No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets.""
So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate.
It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world.
And I have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.
And I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That's long-term debt, very low interest rates.
In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, ""Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion""? I said, ""I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it.""
But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York — many other places all over the world.
So the total is $8,737,540,00.
Now I'm not doing that...
I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not.
I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.
We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.
So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion.
According to the economists — who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying — that $24 trillion — we're very close — that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon.
So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare.
I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
Mark my words.
Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.
I will find — within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around.
I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you.
I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump,"" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, ""You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened"" — it's up in the prison area — ""my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting.""
I said, ""Very interesting.""
So protect the Second Amendment.
End — end Common Core. Common Core should — it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end — education has to be local.
Rebuild the country's infrastructure.
Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.
I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.
You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.
Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.
So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.
You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.
Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.
Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost.
Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.
Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.
And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.
Sadly, the American dream is dead.
But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again.
Thank you. Thank you very much.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9998959302902222,Populist

Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Friends, delegates and distinguished guests, please, I stand before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years.
We begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible, only 24 hours ago.
And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. And congratulations, thank you for that great job out there. We really appreciate it.
We are one national family. And we will always protect, love and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy. For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady.
I also want to thank my amazing daughter, Ivanka, for that introduction — and to all of my wonderful children — Ivanka, please stand up.
And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.
Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our Vice President Mike Pence.
And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen.
My fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
In a new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity.
We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement.
We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.
Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.
Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the People's House, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story.
This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future.
Within these walls lived tenacious generals, like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and unchartered continent.
In the depths of a bloody civil war, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument, and asked God, in his providence to save our nation.
Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill. And just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.
In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering life-saving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner.
We will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before.
What united generations past was an unshakeable confidence in America's destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country's blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world.
It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism.
This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger.
This is the most important election in the history of our country.
Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between the parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas. This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny.
It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades.
Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won't happen.
At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight I ask you a simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?
In the Left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.
Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore our souls; we put our faith in almighty God.
Joe Biden is not a savior of America's soul; he is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses... And told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands.
Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.
Four years ago I ran for president because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by -- -- as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments.
And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg who heads NATO was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do.
Thank you. From the moment I left my former life behind -- and it was a good life I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive. Breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics: I kept my promise.
Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You've seen that. They are angry at me because, instead of putting them first, I very simply said America first.
Thank you.
Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration's job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership.
I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines.
Ended the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord.
And secured for the first time American energy independence.
We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before.
Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world.
Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind.
But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far.
They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA. But again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.
And right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.
And perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration.
But I refused to back down, and today America's borders are more secure than ever before.
Thank you.
We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud. Took down human traffickers who prey on women and children. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens.
We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete. And it is working beyond our wildest expectations.
We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union representing our country's courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people.
You see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do.
They do. They really do. Love and respect. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacement, I promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented American workers have been rehired and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia.
They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much.
You've been through a lot. Thank you very much.
Last month, I took on Big Pharma. You think that's easy? It's not. And signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures. We passed the decades-long awaited right-to-try. Right-to-try.
We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice.
Our great veterans, we're taking care of our veterans.
91 percent approval rating this month, the VA, given by our veterans. First time anything like that's ever happened.
By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great, new Supreme Court justices.
And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones and long-term funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans ever recorded.
And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president.
And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.
And when I'm re-elected, the best is yet to come.
Thank you very much.
When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging. Iran was on the rise. And the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal.
Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel's true capital and moved our embassy to Jerusalem.
But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already-owned existing building in a better location, real estate deal, right?
And opened it at a cost of less than $500,000.
Many things like that that government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.
And this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years.
Thank you to UAE. Thank you to Israel.
In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Then in a separate operation, we eliminated the world's number one terrorist by far, Qassem Solemeini.
Unlike previous administrations I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors.
We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.
We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.
Biden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single-worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time.
After those Biden calamities the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They didn't want to hear Biden's hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.

As vice president, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry.
He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I've reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that, upon very good information.
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused, all over the world, they caused.
In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out.
We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude.
Many Americans, including me, have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken. So unnecessary. In their honor we will unite, in their memory we will overcome.
And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle.
Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike, please stand up. Please.
We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front-line healthcare workers. To protect our nation's seniors we rushed supplies, testing kits and personal... to nursing homes, we gave everything you can possibly give and we're still giving it because we're taking care of our senior citizens.
The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals. And the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world.
America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere combined. Think of that.
We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that on Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives.
Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 percent since April. 80 percent.
The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.
All together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that.
We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That's one of the reasons that we're advancing so rapidly with our economy.
Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, and that's a record in the history of our country.
Unfortunately, from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.
Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children's, families and citizens of all backgrounds.
The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more.
Joe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it's a surrender to the virus.
My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower risk Americans to safely return to work and to school and we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work.
They have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school.
Most importantly, we are marshalling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time.
Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials, right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. Normally it would be years and we did it in a matter of a few months.
We're producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year. And together we will crush the virus.
At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that's not because they don't have one; it's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee.
Joe Biden may claim he is an 'ally of the light,' but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark.
He doesn't have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy.
And once again, record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse. That means your 401(k)s, that means all of the stocks you have.
On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hard-working moms and dads. I will not raise taxes. I will cut them, and very substantially.
And we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America, and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas.
We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as I've already been doing for quite some time, if you've noticed. Joe Biden's agenda is ""Made in China."" My agenda is ""Made in the USA.""
Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states. Absolutely destroying those states, and others.
Millions of jobs will be lost. And energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week, everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody has seen anything like it. But we saw that last week in California.
How can Joe Biden claim to be an ""ally of the light,"" when his own party can't even keep the lights on.
Joe Biden's campaign has even published a 110 page policy platform, you can't get away from this. Coauthored with far left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders.
The Biden Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch and release and providing illegal aliens with free, taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come on over to our country, everybody has a lawyer, we have a lawyer for you. That's what we need is more lawyers.
Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised, here give away -- he was going to give it away, your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring healthmassive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to get, education, healthcare, everything.
He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto.
The Biden plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he's even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?
Biden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term I will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in America.
And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve.
Great people. Great, great people. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable. Yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth.
Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving America's soul.
Tonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a God-given right to life.
During the Democrat Convention, the words ""under God"" were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance, not once, but twice. We will never do that.
But the fact is, this is where they're coming from. Like it or not. This is where they're coming from. If the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms.
Biden is a trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many, many, we see them all the time, it's incredible, actually, then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He's not.
The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods.
When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, ""Yes, absolutely."" When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department a cancer that is rotten to the root, Biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website. Displayed it in big letters.
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon.
No one will be safe in Biden's America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement.
Every day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe. And every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.
One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD, or New York's finest, who I was very, very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. Great, great people.
If they were allowed to do their job. You'd have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy.
Three years ago on the 4th of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.
Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored detective Familia's extraordinary life. It was extraordinary.
Detective Familia's three children are with us this evening, Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much.
I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that's the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power.
They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you.
And those who suffer most are the great people who they protect and who they want to protect at an even higher level.
When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule.
In the strongest possible terms the Republican party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York, many others, Democrat-run.
There's violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we're ready to go in. We'll take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It's too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call.
We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, right outside, I signed an order immediately. 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle, it all stopped. No more statues.
They said, that's just too long, as they looked at a statue. I think we'll rip it down. Then they said 10 years in prison I think that's too long, let's go home.
During their convention Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned.
Now they're starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water.
It's too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago and other cities, Joe Biden's campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it.
At least 13 members of Joe Biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters and rioters from jail.
Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters.
We're honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann and beloved family members Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Great man. Great man. As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity and peace.
If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters and flag burners, that is up to them. But I, as your president, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.
Last year over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities.
Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. government, just think of that.
Liberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent.
In every case attacks on American institutions are being waged by radical left.
Always remember they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. That's what's happening.
And it's been going on from before I even got elected.
And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let's see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the Left's repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases. And the ever-more restrictive political decrees.
Many things have a different name now. And the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it.
The far Left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad.
But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land.
They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds in communities in the best neighborhoods in the world.
They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is I'm here -- -- what's the name of that building?
But I'll say it differently. The fact is we're here and they're not.
To me one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world, it's not a building, it's a home, as far as I'm concerned. It's not even a house, it's a home. It's a wonderful place, with an incredible history.
But it's all because of you. Together we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones.
Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our resilience for bad things, we will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We're taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home.
We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next ten months, and it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.

We will have strong borders. And I've said for years, without borders we don't have a country. Don't have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars.
We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda. -- which is illegal. We'll ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
And if we don't win, your Second Amendment doesn't have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.
We will protect Medicare and Social Security.
We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin.
We will end surprise medical billing; require price transparency, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They're coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number one in the world and keep America energy-independent.
And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven't seen that in a long time.
We will win the race to 5G and build the world's best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect -- we will always, always protect free speech on college campuses.
And we put a very big penalty in -- if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again it's amazing how open they've been lately.
We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars.
This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy or vision than there is right now.
Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world.
Our country wasn't built by cancel culture, speech codes and soul-crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud and independent American patriots.
We're a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. And we have steel in our spines and grit in their souls and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.
I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise, with hard work, devotion and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition.
Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn until dusk. These pioneers didn't have money. They didn't have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families. They loved their country, and they loved their God.
When opportunity beckoned -- -- they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons and set out west for the next adventure.
Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers, they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier.
Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crocket and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon they had churches and communities. Then towns. And with time, great centers of industry and commerce.
That is who they were. Americans build their future. We don't tear down our past. We are the nation -- -- that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature.
And we did it all with style and confidence and flair because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American liberty.
They had no fear, but America didn't stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag, planted on the face of the moon.
For America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show that the world, for America, there is a dream. And it is not beyond your reach.
Together we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable, because together we are the proud citizens of the United States of America.
And on November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before.
I'm very, very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.",0.5643898844718933,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43555209040641785,Populist

I'm thrilled to be in Latrobe, the home of the late, great, my friend, Arnold Palmer. What a great guy he was. What a great guy. Thank you very much. Sixty-one days from now, we're going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and we are going to win four more years in the White House.
Joe Biden wants to surrender your jobs to China, you know that. His son walked out with a lot of money for doing nothing. He wants to surrender your nation to the radical left-wing mob. He's trying to change now, you know, he's saying... That's not working because we're going up and he's dropping like a rock in water.
And before the China virus, this election was over. Now I had to go back to work and we've done a great job on it. We don't get the credit. We don't get the credit. We made a lot of governors look very good. But I will keep your jobs in America, and I'll bring rioters, looters, violent extremists, anarchists, we will bring them to justice. That's what we're doing right now. We have over 400 right now under arrest. These are bad people.
Over the last three and a half years, we've secured America's borders, fixed our broken trade deals, rebuilt the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%secured American energy independence, and built the single greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we're going to do it again. Have to do it again. Have to do it again. Gotta do it again.
And it's happening. You see what's happening. Job numbers, retail sale numbers, they're all at records. It's happening. It's happening very fast. It's actually happening in a super V, not a V. It's a super V and you'll see that, and big numbers are coming out and have come out, and just watch your set or watch your newspaper. Read your newspaper. You're seeing numbers that, congressmen, we haven't seen those numbers ever before, actually. We've never seen them. And by the way, we have record stock markets. We have record everything. You're going to have you're going to have an incredible economic year next year. Your stocks are going up. Your 401(k)s are through the roof.
I had a little pause today. People wanted to take some profits and probably somebody said something stupid along the way. But the stock market's at record levels. Think of it. In the, hopefully, rounding the turn on the pandemic, we're rounding that turn, and vaccines are coming along great. You know that, the job that they've done, the doctors, everybody else, we're years ahead of schedule. Anybody else as president, you wouldn't be talking about vaccines for two or three years from now. I'll tell you right now. That I can tell you.
Biden will never be able to protect your jobs or your family. He is a puppet of the socialists, Marxists, and the cop-hating extremists. And they are cop-hating. And we love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. And by the way, we have... I don't know if you saw this, if there's any way of you seeing it, we have thousands of people behind this hangar, thousands, and we're trying to get them in. And I'd love to get them in. I mean, it's an airport. Let them go to the runways. Okay? Let them in. I mean, literally there, we landed. I actually thought that was the crowd. You know, we're doing the hanger thing now because the arenas can't do it because of the pandemic for a while, a little while. But in certain ways, I like this better. I don't have to travel. I get off the plane. I make a speech. I get the hell out of here.
No, these are great. Do you remember the last days before the campaign? I'd do a lot of them a day. Get off that plane. It was a little different plane. It was black and white instead of the blue and white. But we had some time. And that was an important, that was an important day and that was an important year, 2016. But I will tell you, the election that we have coming up is the single most important election in the history of this country. And we had a level of enthusiasm, I mean, even look today. With all going on, look at the kind of crowds we have.
But we had record enthusiasm in 2016. By the way, was that greatest evening ever? November. And now it's going to be November 3rd, and we'll keep it going and we'll get it all like a tree. You move that tree. It takes a little while to plant, your tax cuts. They're gonna raise your taxes. They're gonna take away your guns. It's really, if you look... And you know, they'll criticize me for saying this, the fake news media, which is back therewith their fake, with their fake polls. The same as last year. We could just put it all on tape. The fake polls, the fake everything. The fake... You know, they're called suppression polls. They're meant to make you depressed. Are you depressed? You don't look depressed.
The real numbers, we have the real numbers. We're leading everywhere. We are leading everywhere. I'll tell you, I thinkI think we're way ahead of what we were four years ago, and there's far more enthusiasm. Our base is bigger. It's stronger. And we've done the greatest job. Again, if we didn't get hit by the plague from China, this thing... We wouldn't have even... Between us, I would have canceled, Mr. Congressman, most of the rallies. I wouldn't have needed a rally. That's a little bit unfair, but that's okay. That's what China's done to our nation. They've screwed us for a long time on a lot of different ways. Never has anybody ripped off our nation like China, and I've taken in billions and billions of dollars. We never took, we never took in 10 cents from China. And I gave 28 billion, right, 28 billion to the farmers because they were targeted unfairly by China. And our farmers are very unhappy.
I don't think we have too many farmers in this wonderful Pennsylvania town. I know we have a lot of boilermakers over there. We got a lot of boilermakers, I'll be talking about them. Look at those guys. Nobody gonna mess with them, I'll tell you. We're gonna be talking about them in a minute, but...
For the entire summer, Biden was silent as far-left rioters viciously attacked law enforcement in Democrat-run cities all, burned down businesses, terrorized civilians, and just recently marched through the streets chanting, ""Death to America."" This is what we have. Death to America.
And by the way, we could end it, like, immediately. You saw what we did in Wisconsin. It ended. It took a while for the governor. You know, they have to ask us in. It's like, otherwise we have to do something much bigger and it's totally unnecessary. The National Guard is fantastic. I went to see them two days ago. Biden went there today. There was nobody there. There was nobody there. He was a little late. I was gonna say, ""Hey, listen, we ended that problem."" But we could end it in Portland. Wise guys in Portland. Anarchists. They're agitators. They're looters. I'll tell you, we could end it in Portland in a half an hour.
We did it in Seattle. We told them, ""We're coming in. You either end it or were coming in."" Congressmen, we were going in the next day. We were all set. I was actually disappointed, to be honest. They ended it in Seattle. They took over 20% of the city. Do you believe this? And the mayor said, ""No, it's gonna be a summer of love."" These people are crazy. So we end them very quickly. We end them very quickly. And now what we're doing is we're holding back funds for cities that don't know what they're doing, where they allow crime to run rampant.
And we put a 10-year prison sentence at anybody that knocks down a statue. I took out an old ordinance, a very old one, because today in Congress, you don't get things like that today. They think that you should just have no cash bail. You know, they do the no cash bail. You kill somebody. There's no bail. Don't worry about it. Go out. But I took out an old ordinance. I gave a new executive order. It says 10 years in prison. And amazingly, amazingly, that was, like, three and a half months ago. And they were having a big march on Washington, march elsewhere, and amazingly, that was the end of the statues coming down. No statutes.
And we're actually prosecuting people for having done it. We made it retroactive to the beginning. Terrible. Terrible. And by the way, the state statues and monuments, they have to do the same thing. It's real easy. But the rioters that want Biden to win, they want him to win because their agenda is an agenda... It's what they want. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen. They both want to cut funding for police. They wanna end that cash bail. They wanna hire far left prosecutors and judges, and let the criminals run wild. The radical left District Attorney in Portland, Mike Schmidt, his name is, has released hundreds of rioters that announced that anyone arrested for interfering with police officers, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, rioting, and other offenses will not be prosecuted under any circumstance.
Oh, it's worse. It's worse. You have somebody in Philadelphia who's worse, right?
Worse. In his manifesto with Bernie Sanders, that's what it is, Biden agreed to all these things. You know, you notice now, ""No, no. I never said about fracking. I never said."" If you don't do fracking in Pennsylvania, 900,000 jobs and your energy bills will triple. Other than that, I don't think you should have it. Okay? No, but he said in the manifesto, plus he said many times, you know, we put on the clip yesterday where he, ""No fracking, no this, no that,"" I mean, no guns. How about guns? No guns. No Second Amendment.
Biden has pledged to appoint prosecutors who extend these insane far-left policies nationwide. That's what he's done. That's called the manifesto. He agreed to all this stuff. The craziest thing, you know, you're supposed to bring it to the right. He actually brought it further left. Bernie never dreamt that this was possible, Crazy Bernie. Do you know Crazy Bernie? You know, I had a lot of his voters come to me four years ago, a big percentage. You know why? Because I agree with him and he agrees with me on one thing, trade. The trade. Because he knew that other countries are ripping us off and so did I. Nobody else got it. Especially Biden never got it. He never got it. Still doesn't get it. Now he really gets nothing, I tell you. He didn't get it in prime time. Now he really doesn't get it.
But it's okay for them to make every city look just like Portland which is a disaster. And again, we could clean it up. We just go right through it. Five thousand, 10,000, right through it. These guys are tough. They're smart. And they love our country. They love our country. We'll clean it up in one half hour. It'll be over.
Did you see this radical left, Mayor Wheeler, his name is. The radical left mayor. They chased him, Mike. They chased him out of his home last night. And all he does is be nice to them because they don't understand nice. They only understand one thing: strength. That's the only thing they... They don't understand nice. They chased him out of his home. Unbelievable. Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists and my plan is to arrest them and prosecute them.
And I will always defend law-abiding citizens. That's why the rioters are voting for Biden and the law enforcement people, you know, we have it from everybody. We just got the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, all of them. We got Ohio. We got Texas. We got North Carolina. We got South Carolina. We got everybody. I don't know if there's anybody... And I see Rick Perry right there. Rick Perry, what are you doing here, Rick? Rick Perry, one of the greats. But they're all voting for me.
This election is about safety and this election is about jobs. Today, I'm delighted to accept a very, very special endorsement from people I like. Sort of grew up with these people. I don't know what it is, the relationship we have with all of us, with all of us. But I'm endorsing, I'm getting an endorsement tonight from some very, very special people. They work hard. They do great. We really put them back to work because this state was in trouble. And last year, you had the single greatest year, economic year, in the history of your whole operation, right? Of your whole operation. You've never had anything like that. This has been your greatest. This has been, prior to the plague coming in, it's been the Commonwealth's greatest. Can we ever call the Commonwealth a state? You have two places. But you always have to say, ""Well, wait a minute. Is this one a Commonwealth?"" Two places. You know what the other place is? Name it. Huh? That's right. How did you know that, Congressmen? Huh?
But this Commonwealth, it's a great Commonwealth. It's a great place. And the boilermakers, local unionit's Local 154 of the boilermakers. They chartered in Pittsburgh 125 years ago. None of you were around to see itand it now represents members in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. And I wanna thank John Hughes and the boilermakers here today. It's a great honor to have you. Let me... Who's John? Where the hell is John? Stand up, John. John, we appreciate it. We appreciate it.
Do you know why John is the head? You know why? Because look, he's got the worst location. I say, ""Where's John?"" I'm looking in the front row. He's in... Put up your hand, John. Look at that guy. He's great. You've got my vote, John. Hey, boilermakers, thank you. What a job you do. You're the heart of this country. You really are. Thank you very much. That's a great endorsement. That's a great endorsement.
Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping Pennsylvania jobs to China and foreign nations, and I've spent the last four years bringing them back home and we're bringing them back home. Bringing a lot of things back home. I ended the last administration's eight-year pure war on Pennsylvania oil, and coal, and fracking, and natural... If you look at the natural gas, what they've done to this state, what they were doing to this state. It was sort of easy. I just opened it up and I said, ""Do it."" And the investment put into Pennsylvania, the investment put into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been record-setting. But again, you had the greatest year you've ever had last year prior to the virus. You're going to be set. Now with what we're doing, I believe that this next quarter, which will be announced, interestingly, just prior to the election, so I'm putting myself on the line, but I know what's going to happen. The numbers are gonna be great. And next year is gonna be one of the greatest years not only for Pennsylvania, but for the entire country.
So Joe Hidin', we have a new one, Joe Hidin'. We call him Joe Hidin'. I have all. What do you like better? What do you like better? We got a number. Let's do a little poll. Can we do a poll? I saved myself so much money. You know, I saved myself so much money. We do these polls with thousands, and those people are coming in from the back, are they not? Yes? They're coming in. I'm telling you, wouldn't have believed it. I'm landing. I wasn't waving at you. I was waving at them. There's more. But I do these polls. Right? And it's like a perfect poll. Do you ever see the companies? You give them a million bucks and they do a poll, like ""78 people were polled."" Now you've got thousands of people.
So tell me. What's your feeling, first of all in the name You like MAGA, Make America Great Again? Yes? Oh, you are the one. You are a man. I made you famous today. You said the nicest things about me. Thank you. Did you see him on television today? I think you're great. I think you're great. Thank you. No, he called me a great Christian and a great Christian leader. Thank you. But he did say I wasn't perfect, but that's okay. I said thank you, anyway. Right? No, that was really great. That was really great.
But if you look at it, the things they've done, we're gonna go through a couple of different polls as we go along because I love the people saying, ""do this"" or ""do that."" But one of the things I got you out of is this thing sounds so good but it's so bad. It's a rip off of our country. The so-called Paris Climate Accord. It's a disaster, a death sentence. It's a death sentence for your energy jobs. I took it out. I withdrew from that calamity. Biden pledged to reinstate it. It's gonna cost you billions and billions of dollars. You know what it really is? It's a way of really taking advantage of the United States. This is what it is. Last year I visited the Shell Petrochemical Plant in Beaver County. Anybody ever hear of Beaver County?
The largest investment in your state's history, all made possible by our pro-energy policies. Biden would wipe out that entire industry, killing the jobs of more than 600,000 Pennsylvania workers. It's probably 940,000, they say. Think of that. Also, prices and everything else. Now Biden today came out and said, ""No, no, fracking's okay, it's okay."" Did you see that? ""Fracking's okay."" Because he was getting killed. And now he came out in favor of law enforcement. Look at all these handsome cops here. And a beautiful cop.
No, but how can anybody believe it? He's totally against, at his speech and at the DNC, where we got much higher numbers than they did, but, you know, they put out that they did, they'll say anything. We got much higher by millions and millions of people. We had a great... Did we have a great convention? Right? We had a... There's my guy. Good job you did. But we had a great convention and it's been really terrific. You know, I made a speech at Mount Rushmore and since that speech, our numbers have been up, up, up like a rocket, like a beautiful rocket, the Mount Rushmore speech. I said, you know, we're getting hit by this pandemic very unfairly in the sense that we've done such a good job with the ventilators, all of the things, you know, you've heard it a thousand times, and we have to get back. And I made a speech in, really, a great place, South Dakota, but it was Mount Rushmore. You know, they wanna blow it up. You know, they wanna take off Mount... Right? If you would see how beautiful, if you would see how beautiful this is, it was like this perfect evening, the sun was setting, the faces of these great, great, majestic heroes of our country, right? Heroes of our country. And they wanna blow up Mount Rushmore. But how about this one? The Democrats yesterday came out with a plan. Did you see it? Now, they're the DC Democrats. They wanna change the name of the Washington Monument, perhaps take it down.
Thomas Jefferson, pretty good, Thomas Jefferson, right? You could forget about ever hearing that name again. Abraham Lincoln, you could forget about it. They wanna take down all statues, all monuments in Washington. We have some of your greatest people right here. Let me not even talk to the congressmen. The heck with the congressman, the boilermakers. How do you like it? How do you like the idea of taking down our statues to our great George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, all of them? I don't think the boilermakers... You'll ring... You'll do a ring around Washington right? Along with Christopher Columbus. He's in big trouble, I'll tell you. Except there was one, there was a group of great Italians in New York, they tried to take down...
They tried to take down Christopher Columbus statue in New York. You saw what happened, right? These Italians formed a little circle. They said, ""Come on."" The agitators decided to leave. ""Let's get outta here, darling."" They protected Christopher Columbus. The Italians, no, the Italians aren't big on taking down Christopher Columbus. You take down those statues, you can forget about the Italian vote. Do we agree? But they protected it. When asked at the debate if there would be any place for fossil fuels, including coal, and fracking, and natural gas, and so many things that really fire up these big plants where many of you work, and they produce just millions and millions of jobs throughout our country, Biden said, ""No, we would absolutely not allow anything like that. We would make sure it's totally eliminated."" That's what he said. He said, ""We would make sure it's totally eliminated or eliminated."" Now he's coming and saying, ""This isn't working too well. This isn't working.""
And I made a speech a week ago in Texas. We had crowds that were unbelievable, on the highways, you can't get in, but the highways, it's, like, incredible. You could sell your ticket tonight for a lot of money, go to eBay. Even as a used ticket, you could probably sell. But you go down the highways and you see it, and I was thinking of Texas, I'm making a speech in front of, obviously, people that like oil, they like God, and you know what else they like? They like their Second Amendment, right? So think about it. So whether it's Pennsylvania, or Texas, or Oklahoma, or North Dakota, or any, any place, you take a look at this, right? And no oil, no guns, no God. I don't think George Washington running with Abraham Lincoln as his VP, he'll pick Abraham Lincoln as VP, is gonna win in Texas, or in Pennsylvania, or any place else with those three things eliminated.
That's what they wanna do. They wanna take away your Second Amendment. If I weren't president, you would either have an obliterated Second Amendment or it would be gone entirely. I am standing between them and your Second Amendment. And that's it. That's it. They know.
They put Beto in charge of guns. Beto is in charge, he wants to get rid of everything. Beto, that's a beauty. Remember he said, ""I was born for this."" Anybody that says they're born for this... Remember Beto? He was on the cover of a magazine, I won't mention the magazine, they're back there. It's a total phony magazine. But he was on the cover of the magazine. And he said, ""I was born to run for president."" He was born for it. ""I was born..."" Anybody that gets that character. That was when he was doing well. Since then he's cratered. Ever since he made that statement, he's looked very bad. But he's... Take a look at what he says about guns, and he got put in charge of guns. So I guess Biden pretty soon is gonna be coming out saying, ""No, no. I never said that.""
Check out all of the statements he's made on everything and now he's going the opposite way, but he's agreed to the manifesto entirely so maybe he'll do that. And then he figures later on, he'll go. But everything he said is right, because he has no control over what's happening. The j has captured the party. They even elected a person that nobody ever heard of, a senator, it's been a while, against a young, good-looking Kennedy by 10 points in Massachusetts. Did you know Kennedy lost in Massachusetts? You know why? Because he wasn't a radical left. He was like a semi-normal person, just slightly left. No, but think of it. This is what's happened. And this is really what's happened. If you're not a radical lefty, meaning guns, meaning fossil fuels, they want wind, wind. You know, to make the windmill, which are made mostly in China, and in Germany, by the way, to make it, so much emission is let out, that is more than you can ever save.
It's just the craziest thing. Also, I'm a big... I am truly an environmentalist, but you have to understand. When we do things and they don't, and we clean, and it's very expensive to do that, and they don't, and we have this massive planet, and China, India, Russia, Germany, all these places, it's fuming up and we're doing our job and beautiful. No, they have to do it also. Otherwise, it just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. They wanna ban straws. Has anybody ever tried those paper straws? They're not working too good. Right? They wanna ban straws, I said, ""Well, you know, I've had a couple of meals at McDonald's, et cetera, over the years, right? Wendy's, a friend of mine owns Wendy's, I'll give it a plug, right? Burger King."" So they wanna ban straws. I said, ""Oh really? What about the carton? What about the plate? What about the knives and the spoons that are plastic?"" ""Oh, they're okay, but the straws we gotta ban."" Has anybody ever tried, seriously, the new straw, it's made out of paper, right? It disintegrates as you drink and if you have a nice tie like this tie, this would have no chance. By the time you get finished, the straw is totally disintegrated. Does anybody walk around with a plastic straw? Because it's not bad. You know, you whip it out, boom, boom. You never had to do that.
When asked whether he would be willing to destroy the jobs of hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers to push his anti-energy agenda, you know what the answer is, right? It's the Green New Deal, right? This Green New Deal. This was made by... This was made up... This was made up by people that don't get it. Either that or people that just don't like our country very much. But Biden replied yes, he'll get rid of those jobs. And he famously told a voter, ""I want you to look in my eyes,"" when he's not wearing the mask because I've never seen a man that liked their mask. Look, I'm all for it, we have a big weekend, distance on the weekend, and all of that stuff, and wear your mask when you're close together in particular, and wash your hands, all those things. We have Labor Day weekend coming up. But did you ever see a man that likes a mask as much as him? And then he makes a speech and he always has it, not always, but a lot of times he has it hanging down. Because you know what? It gives him a feeling of security.
If I were a psychiatrist... Right? No, I'd say, I'd say, ""This guy's got some big issues."" Hanging down. Hanging down. Congressman, give me your mask. I wanna have it hanging from my ear. I don't wanna touch your damn mask. Mike, I'll never touch your mask. No, but the new one is, you know, I went for a physical, the doctor said to me, ""Sir, would you like to go over to Walter Reed? It's incredible."" By the way, the job they do on people that have been just really hurt, our heroes. And the job they do is incredible. ""Sir would you like to go over and do a physical? You have some time."" You know why I had time? Some deal, oh, it was China. I decided not to see China because I didn't like the way they were doing business, okay? Does that make sense?
So the doctor, White House doctor, highly respected, Sean, Sean Conley, ""Sir, would you like to go over and do your physical, or do a piece of it, or finish it?"" or whatever it was, but do a physical. I said, ""I don't know. I'm not in love with the idea."" ""Well, if you do it, you don't have to do..."" ""Okay. Let's go. Come on."" So we went, we went, and we're driving. Now you have to understand, they're like a hundred cars. You see what happens here. It's like the plane times 50. So the cars are driving all over, it's about a 20 minute drive and we get to the hospital, I get out. I was there probably for an hour and a half, two hours. And then yesterday I read that I had strokes. CNN, fake news CNN right there.
No, it's true. Mini-strokes, they called them. I don't know what a mini-stroke is, but it's not good. And there could be a day and I'll admit, I said ""Hey, it happens all of us."" Right? Except these young ones. It's never gonna happen to them. They're not looking at that, but you know what happens?
But nothing happened. So I went in, I did that part of the physical. The end result was, ""He's very healthy."" They were very unhappy when they heard that result. What you don't remember is when this took place, it was a long time ago. They just started up because they wanna try and get me to be in Biden's physical level. They view me as being somebody that's, you know, I go around, hey, last week, this week, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, South Carolina, back to Washington. Let's go here, let's go there, let's go everywhere. Meetings all the time. I think I've answered more questions from these maniacs than any president in history. And mean questions. You know, I watched Biden yesterday, so he hasn't answered questions in what, two months or something. And yesterday he took a couple and they were set-ups like I've never seen. One young woman, who I think is there, one young woman is smiling, ""Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi. I'd just like to ask you, I'm sorry to bother you with this question."" It's the most incredible.
So the doctor wrote a letter saying, ""No, this rumor is wrong."" And I don't like, you know, rumors like that. And by the way, if it were a fact, it's fine, it should. I think it's an important thing. But if it's not true, my wife was like, she came to me, she said, ""I think I would have known that."" I said, ""Yeah, I think they would have known it too, because they drove back with me."" You know, the press follows me, they have a special deal, a van, they followed me and then we go in, we go out. But if you remember, last time, I go in, I spend a little time, a physical like we all have. Hopefully you have them. Good thing to have, I guess, as long as they give you a good answer. If they give you a bad answer don't bother, possibly too late. But I go in, I come out a couple of hours later I guess, whatever it is, it's a short time later, I get into the car, the press sees me get into the car.
On my way home, I get a call from my wife, the first lady, who's very popular. Do we like our first lady? She's very popular, great person, great woman. She said, ""Darling, are you okay?"" I go, ""Why do you ask?"" She said, ""They're reporting that you had a heart attack."" Now you have to understand, I'm driving in a car, which is about, what? Six cars in front of the press? Because they have a big car. They're a lot of them and we try and give them as little room as possible, make it uncomfortable. But they're right behind me. So they know I got in and CNN reported that I had a heart attack. That was the same visit, and that didn't work. No, it's unbelievable.
CNN reported I had a heart attack so my wife was concerned. I said, ""No, not that I know of. And if I did, I think I'd be back there. No. I'll be home in 15 minutes, darling. Thank you for caring."" It's always nice. It's always nice. She sounded relieved. That's good. When your wife sounds relieved. But she said, ""I wonder how that happened. Why did they do that?"" Because they're fake news. So I go in, and that rumor lasted for a little while, like a day or two. It lasted for a little while, no matter what I did. I'm in the same motorcade, I go in, and I go out. They know I'm in the motorcade, I actually have to report it, but I'm in the motorcade, and they said I had a... One of them said it was a massive heart attack. Think of it. Again, it could happen someday, okay? And when it does, I hope things work out. But they knew I'm in the motorcade and yet they reported it anyway because they fake news.
Now for the same visit, that was the stupidest thing. From now on, when I go for a physical or something or go to the hospital, announce it, because this was a quick thing. The doctor, he got me in a lot of trouble. He's a great doctor. I said, ""No more surprise visits to the hospital where we do a little work because we have some time."" But, so now, the same visit they started yesterday because some joker from the New York Times, who's a third-grade reporter writes a book and he said, ""The vice president was prepared to take over the reins because they thought the president was going to go,"" I guess, under anesthesia. Do they still call it...? In the old days they called it anesthesia. It's essentially the same thing. I don't wanna get into a situation like where Biden used ""record player."" Remember that? ""You go home, you turn on your record player."" But the anesthesia. And I said, ""How could that be?"" So remember, this is the same visit, same visit.
They said heart attack a long time. All of a sudden out of this book. And he said, ""Suffered mini-strokes."" Now they get a letter from the White House doctor that said it's totally false, totally false. But they still go with it, they go with it. And they know I'm in the group with them coming back. And if... I don't know much about a mini-stroke, but I assume Mr. Congressman, if you have a mini-stroke, you're not heading back to the White House, right? At least you'll spend a couple of nights at that great hospital, right? So anyway, these are really dangerous people. They are so bad for our country. If we had honest press, it would be so great for the USA. It would be so great. They're just a bunch of phony people. Not all of them. You have some very good ones, like about 10%. No, you have some very good ones, you have some great journalists, they know it's phony stuff. They're doing anything they can to get this sleepy guy into the White House and I just don't think the public is gonna fall for it.
I don't think the public is gonna fall for it. You know, in his best days, 25, 30 years ago, he was weak. He was weak. As a Senator, he was weak. He was not known as being one of the smart ones and now it's not exactly prime time, I can tell you that. I just want to announce tonight because we're joined with some very, very special warriors and Dan Meuser, Dan, thank you very much. Great job you're doing. Dan, congressman. He's a congressman who have really been warriors for me. You really have been. Thank you very much Dan. Fred Keller, Fred, thank you. Great job, Fred. The great John Joyce. Great, thank you, John. Guy Reschenthaler. Do you know him? Guy Reschenthaler. What are you doing over there? What happened? You don't get along with these guys? Oh, okay. That's good. Now I understand. That's good. Glenn Thompson. Great job, great job Glenn, really great. And a real good friend of mine, right from the beginning, right, Mike? You know, we were in Pennsylvania and a friend of ours, a congressman, long-term, right? From Kentucky. No, from actually Tennessee, came up to us, I was getting ready to make a speech, and Tennessee has very early voting. Remember what he said? This was four years ago. He said, ""I don't know what's happening in Pennsylvania. I don't know what's happening in the rest of the country. But if what's going on in the rest of the country is like what's going on in Tennessee..."" He said, ""They're coming from the hills, the roadsides, the rivers."" He said they're coming, people that never really cared to vote, they're great Americans, but they never wanted to vote for the people that they would see.
He said, ""They're miles long. They've got Trump gear, Trump hats, Trump pins,"" right? Tennessee. Duncan, Congressman Duncan, right? Remember that, Mike? That was the first time. I mean, they said that they'd never seen anything like it. Tennessee has been incredible by the way. So Mike and I listened and we said, ""I wonder what that's all about."" But it is true. People that weren't really political people, they're coming in, and, you know, the deal here, like the Miss Universe, good old Miss Universe, right? Like this, they came with hats, they came with pins, they're loaded with pins. One person had hundreds of pins. They never have had a pin in their life, but they love the job that we've done and we're gonna do it even better in the next four years.
Another great friend of mine who's a tough cookie and a great congressman. But unfortunately he's a former, because he's just, I don't know. He's just a special guy and really has a big, beautiful heart, Lou Barletta, Lou. You look good Lou. Why don't you run again Lou? And a man who is tough. You know, there's this guy. You ever hear of a guy named Conor Lamb? He's like a lamb. So we heard, you know, because he's in sort of a Trumpy area, right? And we heard that he's gonna be for Trump, but he's gonna be fighting for Trump. And you know, I saw, I saw some of his commercials, I thought he was a Republican, right? Except when he got to Washington, he voted with Pelosi a hundred percent of the time. Crazy Nancy. He voted with Crazy Nancy. And so we thought, this Conor Lamb guy, he even voted to impeach your president over nothing. Zero. Zero. And that's very personal. When they do that, that's personal. So, and I have to say congressmen, 196 to nothing they stuck with us and so did the Senate other than Romney. You can have Romney I think.
Romney couldn't be elected dog catcher in Utah right now. Although he gave me a half a vote. It was 52 and a half to a half. That was Romney, what a beaut. Remember he was walking with the Black Lives Matter saying, ""Yes, I'm a member of Black Lives Matter."" Everyone said, ""That's nice. Wonderful."" He had a lot of mask on, I'll tell you that. But we did a great job, we had a great... It was an amazing thing. But this Conor Lamb was out there fighting it, and he shouldn't have done that. And we have somebody that blows him away. He's more of a hero, he's tougher, he's stronger, he's smarter, he's better-looking, not that that matters. You know, under the Me Too generation, I don't talk about looks anymore. Looks don't matter. Doesn't make any difference. I don't talk about looks. Me Too. Me Too generation. But I'll tell you, this man is something special. He's a real hero, a real tough guy, and he'll never let you down, Sean Parnell.
Just remember that Conor Lamb, and I remember, because he's like a lamb, he's like a little lamb. Weak, got a lot of weak people. We like strong people, don't we? We like strong people. We need strong people right now. We have somebody else in the audience who served as my Secretary of Energy and he was incredible. He was the Governor of Texas for what? Twelve years I think, Rick, right? Twelve? Tell me. Fourteen? Fourteen years, he was. And he was an incredible governor, and he was an incredible secretary, and he's been an incredible friend. Rick Perry, everybody. There was nobody that got into the race tougher than Rick. What he said about me, I'll never repeat again. Even my own family didn't like me when he got finished. And when he decided that I would be the one, he got out and there's nobody that's said better things about me. But you're great, Rick, and you did a fantastic job. Every place you've been, you've been great. Thank you very much. Rick Perry. Thank you.
Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? Hey Rick, how are we doing in Texas? We had a poll today in Georgia. They say, ""Georgia's gonna be close."" Well, this was a poll that hates Trump and we're up seven. That was the same thing happened last time, right? You know, they use the words in play. ""Georgia's in play,"" they say, ""Georgia's in play."" Well, we're up seven and this is a poll that truly hates us, okay? But they did the last time. Didn't they say last time that Texas was in play? And then it was 8:00, the polls closed and they only announce if you're way ahead. So they say, ""The polls have closed in the great state of Texas, Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas.""
I kept hearing it was in play. They said Utah, the home of our worst senator, they said Utah was in play. That's Mitt Romney. Mike Lee is doing excellent. I didn't wanna get them confused by the way, but, but they say Utah same thing, remember that? Four years ago, we had the guy with the shaved head. What was his name, Rick? What, what a... What a loser that was, you know who I'm talking about. That's right. McMuffin, I think, something like that. And he was gonna win Utah and I won it by many, many, many points, it was called immediately. So these are people that are just not good. In fact, Hillary even beat this guy. Hillary. Hillary came in second in Utah.
In less than four years we've achieved more than anyone thought possible. We passed massive tax cuts for hardworking families and we eliminated more regulations than any administration in the history of our country. I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job-killing catastrophe known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It would have been a catastrophe, not only for autos by the way, for everything else too. To protect our workers, I imposed stiff tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. That kept you guys very busy. They were dumping all over the place, is that right? They were dumping, and it was bad steel too, it was dirt steel. This week my administration reached a breakthrough agreement to stop additional steel imports from Brazil and from Mexico for the rest of the year despite the USMCA, sometimes they get a little carried away and we have to do a little tariff action on them. So we stopped that.
We're reversing decades of the Biden betrayals that decimated Pennsylvania jobs, you know that. This state lost, listen to this, one in three manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, one of the worst things that happened, when China came in. You know, they were flat-lined for many years, then they came into this crazy deal. They're considered a developing nation, you see, I've been sort of protesting that like, but they're considering China as a developing nation, you get all sorts of things that you would never get, advantages over the United States. Well we have very strongly protested that. They're not a developing nation, they're a very powerful developed nation, and you know what? They gotta pay what everyone else has to pay.
Earlier this year I kept my promise to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement into law which is in effect now and really doing well. Everyone said it will never happen, and I had great help from these gentlemen right here. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's pillaging, plundering, and rampant theft of Pennsylvania and many other places, jobs. That's all throughout the world, by the way, but our states have been just pillaged by China and others. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in America.
After years and years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country, it's called America First. We're America First, that's enough, and we're bringing our soldiers back home. You see what's going on. After 19 years in Afghanistanfar-away places. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created Opportunity Zones, Tim Scott, great senator from South Carolina worked on it with me. Passed criminal justice reform, delivered permanent funding for historically Black colleges and universities that Obama would never do, and before the China virus we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded by far. And they're now heading back in that direction quickly. Democrat politicians have failed the Black community for decades, they've failed the Asian community, the Hispanic community. They've failed women. The numbers on women's unemployment were the best in 61 years. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying the American people. He was always for things that you wouldn't want and now he's changing, ""No, I never said that. I never said that."" I've spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community, and for all communities, and the best is yet to come.
Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration, you know we've been fighting for that. Under my administration we achieved the most secure border in American history. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we've deported 20,000 gang members and we get them out and we get them out fast. Thank you ICE. ICE and Border Patrol. ICE and Border Patrol. They don't like ICE because ICE is... They're tough. You gotta be tough in that job, by the way. Anybody up here like to work in ICE? I don't think so. Let's see, you could probably be okay, but you'd rather do what you're doing, right? I agree with you. These are tough guys, they have to be tough. These are bad, bad gang members. I mean, you look at MS-13, you look at what's happened with MS-13, you look at... We get them the hell out. Sometimes we have to put them in prison because we don't even wanna take a chance, they can come back in after what they've done.
We built 300 miles of border wall and we're adding 10 new miles every single week. Every weekand the wall will be finished very soon and by the way, they keep saying, ""But Mexico will be paying for the wall,"" and I said respectfully to Mexico, but they will be paying for the wall. They understand that, they just don't wanna write it and that's okay too. Because Mexico's treated us very well. The president of Mexico, right now they have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border guarding us from people coming in illegally into our country. We invested 2.5 trillion dollars in the United States military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in nearly 75 years since the Air Force, and that's called the Space Force. Right, Sean? Pretty good. Gonna send Mike into space, you wanna go into space, bud? Our great congressman, but think of that. You know, we created a new branch of the United States... That alone, if you had that, that alone, but then you add judges, all the other things. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability. So now instead of waiting for a week, two weeks, five weeks, nine weeks to see a doctor, you don't have a doctor, you go right out, you get a private doctor, we pay the bill, and our great veterans get better quickly. And accountability, we keep people accountable for the way they treat our veterans and if they don't treat them well, we say, ""Sorry, you're fired. Get out."" No, we couldn't fire anybody. We had sadists, we had thieves, we had some very bad people in the VA and they're all gone. Thank you, I love you too, thank you. Thank you. Such friendly voices. Quite beautiful. Only in Pennsylvania, right? Thank you.
I withdrew from the last administration's disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, think of this. Obama paid 150 billion for a short-term deal. He gave 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see a million dollars like at a casino floor or something in 100-dollar bills? It's a lot, it's like the size of this, right? Now think 1.8 billion. How did you guys allow that to happen? Huh? They said, ""We all voted against it."" I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel. You never know nowadays, right? And I opened the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They've been trying to get that done for 52 years, I got it done immediately.
By the way, as far as the capital of Israel, Jerusalem, they've been talking about many, many presidents. They all promised it, nobody did it. I did it. We get things done and we just did something that is incredible. Even the New York Times gave it good reviews, not good reviews, beyond good reviews. Tom Friedman gave it phenomenal reviews, you believe that? And that's... We achieved the first breakthrough in Middle East peace in decades, a deal with Israel right? And the UAE. It's a deal with Israel and the UAE and that's gonna lead, and I will tell you, we have representatives over right now and other people are saying, ""We wanna get in that deal. You'll have peace to the Middle East."" We wanna get the hell out. Let's get them all back. Let's get them all back. Don't forget, we're energy independent. There used to be a reason. Now we do have a reason, it's called Israel, but... And we have some very good partnerships over there. In all fairness, we have some countries that have treated us very well and we're going to take care of those countries, but we are energy independent for the first time and that's a very good feeling.
And our military has never been stronger than it is now. It's new and it's beautiful and I told you we took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi and separately, we killed the world's number one terrorist, number one terrorist for decades and decades, Qasem Soleimani. We killed Soleimani. It's a big step for the Middle East. We kept America out of wars. Remember they always said, ""Oh, this Trump. He's radical, he's really, I mean he's off the... He's too radical. He'll get us in wars."" I kept you out of wars, what happened with North Korea? Look, I get along with Kim Jong-Un. They say, ""That's terrible, he gets along."" No, it's good if I get along. If I get along with Russia, is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it's a good thing.
These maniacs, anytime... They always talk about Russia, they never talk about China. It's very interesting. It's always ""Russia,"" I heard it's starting again, they said somebody spoke to Russia two years ago. Russia, Russia, Russia. This total maniac Shifty Schiff, he's a total maniac. No, it's always... Do you ever notice, I can't even listen to him but when I hear ""Russia"" I just turn it off. It's crazy. But you know, getting along with countries is actually a good thing. Can we explain that? It's a good thing, not a bad thing. It's a very good thing. But remember, I was the one that was gonna be leading you into war, ""In the first week, he'll be in war, he's a radical kind of a personality."" I'm really not, I like to have peace, but if we ever do get into war, we will knock the hell out of them, whoever it may be. These guys only fight to, to tie, they don't fight to win, we fight to win.
But you look at what's happening where... They're all coming back home. I even reduced in Germany because Germany, they're an ally, but you know, they took advantage of us very badly on trade and very badly with our military. So we removed a lot of soldiers out of Germany. They're not happy, they said, ""This is gonna hurt our economy."" Well, it's good for our economy, okay? They thought it was gonna hurt the German economy. Well, they don't treat us right, they don't pay their bills, they're delinquent. You know what delinquent is? They're delinquent. They don't pay their bills. We protect them, they don't pay their bills. We gotta do something, and they treat us horribly on trade through the European Union which basically they run.
Together we've been rapidly fixing a half a century of disasters and Biden was there for every one of them. Joe Biden supported NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade. He supported the Korean deal, the Korean deal was so bad, it was so bad. This was a deal that was going to produce, it's South Korea, done by Crooked Hillary Clinton, this was a deal that was going to produce 250,000 jobs. She said, ""This will be 250,000,"" and she was right, for South Korea. It produced 250,000 jobs. For us, we got nothing. We got no-... We got losses, we got nothing. It was a terrible deal, I renegotiated, now it's a good deal. And they also gave, and wanna give, mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Biden supported cutting Social Security. He voted for the Iraq War, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden. He opposed the killing of Soleimani, when I did that, he said, ""That's a terrible thing. That's a terrible thing."" Everybody in the Middle East, they couldn't believe it. They, they celebrated, some of them quite quietly I must add.
He oversaw the rise of ISIS and he cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the entire world. Remember that? Now he's trying to say, ""Well, I can be tough on China too."" No he can't. China owns him. China owns Sleepy Joe. He's not gonna be tough on China, and he said all these wonderful things and then all of a sudden his poll numbers started going down. How about law enforcement? He's, like, so bad. In his entire convention, they didn't even mention... And by the way, something else they did that I think is terrible, really terrible. The words ""under God,"" right? Right? Right? Called the Pledge of Allegiance. ""Under God,"" he left those two words out twice at their caucus which is part of their convention. But that's where they're coming from. He's trying this, ""Oh well, we didn't do this,"" and then we gave it to him and he sort of shut up, but then two days later he's saying it didn't happen. They lie, and these mail-in ballots? These mail-in ballots are a disgrace and they know it.
Sign your mail-in ballot. You sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it and if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote, and then if for some reason after that, it shouldn't take that long, it comes in, they're not gonna be able to tabulate it because you will have voted. But you have to make sure your vote counts because the only way they're gonna beat us is by doing that kind of stuff. I'm trying to be nice. I'm trying to be nice.
They wanna send out congressmen 80 million ballots. Now there have been many races over the last year where they've done this and they've been a disaster. You look at New York, they had a congressional race, not a very good congresswoman, very untalented, I know her well, I lived in New York. She's not got much going. They have no idea what the vote is, I think 20% of the ballots were missing and then they declared her the winner and the other guy said, ""What about me?"" He's not too happy, her opponent. You look at what happened in Paterson, New Jersey, you look at what happened in Virginia, you look at what happened... There's not a race, and these are small, these are easy to control.
Now they wanna send out 80 million unsolicited, I like it much better, they used to say universal, they used to say live ballots, I like the word unsolicited, and solicited. Solicited is okay, because that's when you're asking and you want it and you send in the necessary paperwork and documentation and you get the ballot and you fill it out, that's okay. But you can't, this whole thing with the unsolicited, unsolicited means you're sitting there. You know, we have a big enthusiasm edge, but when they throw these things in your face and the lists are inaccurate and people are dead and dogs have gotten ballots, they have. Dogs have gotten ballots, and they know I'm right and everybody knows I'm right and they say I'm right behind the closed doors and it's a disgrace, what they do to our country. Eighty million unsolicited ballots. People that had no idea. People that weren't gonna vote, in all fairness. It's really unfair because our people have enthusiasm, they're going out to vote. They're all going out to vote. Everybody here gonna vote? Everybody?
But they have no enthusiasm. I said, ""So that's unfair. That guy walks and then they'll have somebody knock on the door, say, 'Listen, we'd like your ballot.' 'I don't wanna vote. I don't care about Biden. I'm a Democrat. I don't care about this guy.' 'Well look, where is it?' 'Here, take it, blah blah blah.'"" They even have a provision where you don't have to verify signatures. What is going on? And they have another provision in some states where you can harvest, that's where you grab them all together and drop them. And in Nevada, they actually have a provision where they don't have to be counted until seven days after the election. So that means if we have a close election, could be close, I hope it's not, I hope we have a landslide like you've never seen. But if we have a close election that means Nevada has the right to... And I love Nevada, I think we're gonna win Nevada, except where they're sending all these hundreds of thousands, millions of unsolicited ballots to people in Nevada and people that probably left a long time ago. It's very unfair, it's very unfair, but think of it. They have seven days after the election. Did you know that, Mike? Seven days, what does that mean? I wanna see the results of the election on November 3rd. Right?
And by the way, if it's anything like these other events, it could go on forever. I mean, the congressional race, which they just gave up and they declared her a winner which they should not have done, they should make that a do-over, and I think in Paterson they have a do-over. I think they're going to do it over because it was just ripe with fraud, theft. People were selling ballots, people were selling ballots, and you know they talk about Russia. They're so worried about Russia. What about sending out 80 million ballots? That's your real problem, and, you know, if Russia or China or these other countries wanna cheat, all they have to do is forge ballots. It's much easier than the way they have to go about it, right? So we have to put pressure on these people.
Now the good news is we have a lot of court cases, we have won in Pennsylvania, you know that, right? And we have two judges, we have a state judge, we have a federal judge. I think both highly qualified judges from what I understand, I hear that they're not too happy about what they're seeing. So we'll see what happens. We're gonna see what happens. The lawyers feel very confident but we have to win those cases, but what you have to do is send in your early ballot and then go and make sure that ballot is tabulated or counted, and if it's not counted, voteand then they have the job, if it comes in late, and if it's not too late, they have the job of making sure that they don't count it. But follow that ballot because these people, they'll be lost, they'll be gone, the numbers are incredible where they're 25 and 30% off, 20% off. Follow your ballot.
When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Sleepy Joe, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would have died. You know that. You know he's always... He always gets up, today, ""COVID-19, COVID-19."" I say, ""Joe, look. We got a country,"" and I agree with that and we've done a hell of a job. We've done a hell of a job. If you look at some of our numbers. But you gotta start talking about the economy and you gotta start talking, your, your place, I mean this is... When you look at Pennsylvania, you're in a shutdown. You have a governor that has you shut down.
That's right. I didn't even think, I didn't even think about it. You have a governor that has you shut down. That's right. And almost all states are open, and frankly, their numbers are very good. You look at Florida's now way down, Arizona which had a spike, way down. California, Texas is going way down. They're all way down. You haven't even opened up, you haven't even opened up the great Commonwealth. But you have the same thing in North Carolina. And you have the same thing in Michigan. What she's doing to Michigan is sad. And you know, you have death with the shutdown. You have depression. You have drugs and alcohol. You have sickness, you have loss of jobs. And people... You have suicides. Don't even think about it, but you have suicides. You have a tremendous... There's, actually at this stage... We did the right thing. We closed the country down, we studied it, we learned about it. We know the susceptible are old people, senior citizens, nursing homes. People that are old, especially if they have heart problems or if they have diabetes. We know that, we learned it, and we opened it up. But the problem... These shutdowns are causing much bigger problems. You remember my original statement, right? The cure can't be greater. It was an original statement that a lot of people picked up but it's so true. You have to open up this Commonwealth, it has to be opened up. It has to be opened up now.
But there's what I think they're doing, because you have the same thing in New York. We have a governor in New York who is... Thirty-six thousand people died, 11,000 people in a nursing home because he made a mistake. He made a horrible mistake, and I built him a convention center with 2,800 beds and they didn't use it, and I sent up a ship, a great hospital ship, a massive hospital with hundreds and hundreds of rooms and they didn't use it, and he requested it and then I said, ""You're not using it. Why aren't you using it?"" He could have put those people in the convention center, in the hospital ship. What a shame.
But you look at New York, the restaurants are all closed. It's so sad for me. I love New York. You know, I grew up in New York, I love New York, I did well in New York, and it's so sad when I look at what's happening with New York. It's all politics. If you kill somebody they don't prosecute you but they go after political enemies. It's a terrible... What's happening in New York is a terrible thing and the place is dead. No restaurants, the restaurants... Poor guys, you can't... How long can you do this for?
The people are gonna lose their jobs. They're never gonna open again. It's not like the restaurants is the greatest business in the world. It's a hard business. New York is closed. You're closed. North Carolina's closed. Michigan's... All Democrats. Let me tell you what's gonna happen. On November 4th, they're gonna announce their opening. They're doing this for political reasons. They are. Right, John?
They're doing it for political reasons because they want our numbers to look as bad as possible going into November 3rd, Election Day. And then as soon as the election's over with, win, lose, or draw for them, they're gonna, they're gonna open it. They got nothing. And you know what? It's a shame what they're doing. For political reasons, they'll be open. You'll be open on November 4th, but you know what? From your standpoint, it's very close to the election. It's very far if you have a restaurant, and you can't open your restaurant. You can't open your store. It's a disgrace and they ought to get together. They ought to do it.
These are Democrat governors, in all instances, and Democrat mayors. When the China virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Thanks to the life-saving therapies that we pioneered, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% since April. Think of that. And we've achieved among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. You never hear that from the fake news. They don't wanna talk to you about it. And this is a big country. This is a tougher country to do that with, the European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours.
And if you look now, Spain is having a big blow up. France is having a big blow up. No, we've done a great job, we haven't been given credit for it. He always starts off, ""COVID-19."" That's all he knows. ""COVID-19."" I said, ""What about the economy? What about jobs? What about all the other things we have to do?"" All he does... He thinks it's a weak spot, and actually in theory, if we're getting a fair shake from those people back there, it's actually what the job we've done is actually a strong spot.
And that includes you people, with the ventilators that nobody had. Nobody that needed a ventilator, didn't get a ventilator. Now we're supplying them all over the world. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that. You don't hear these numbers. Cases in the US have declined by 28% nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have declined radically over the last week. Three vaccines are in final stage of clinical trials. Would've taken two years for another president. I was gonna say a normal president, but they'll hit me with... A little truth to that too.
No, but for another president, especially... You know, in the last administration, they had the H1N1 pandemic. It was called swine flu. You know, Joe always calls it the N1H1. He gets it mixed up. No, it's the H1N1, Joe. Not that it matters, I guess. No. Do you ever notice, he's always calling it the other. He calls it the opposite. He has no clue where he is, but he keeps saying, ""Oh, if he was..."" Well, he didn't want to ban China, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by banning China. I was the only one that wanted to do it, actually. And then we banned Europe because I saw what was happening in Italy and Spain and France. We banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands. And if I didn't do the closing and the opening, so we're at 175,000, far too... Look, one is too much because this was given to us by China, and it's a disgrace.
It's a disgrace. They could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into China, but not going to the rest of the world, including our country. It's a disgrace. But think of it. Joe Biden got the worst marks you've ever seen for his handling of the H1NI swine flu. They said it was incompetent, and the head guy, who now he's trying to retract. It's a little tough. That's one great thing about the tape. He said it was horrible. He said, ""We did a horrible job."" He said they got lucky. It's not contagious like this. We got, this is a tough one. I can look at that guy and he'll catch it. Right there, and he's very far away from me. It's a tough one, because it's so contagious.
But the swine flu is a different thing, but also, nothing's easy about that, pandemics or epidemics, and his marks... Take a look at the job they did. It was so bad that their top person criticized it, and they went after him. They said, ""Don't ever say that again,"" but it's a little late. He said it was one of the worst jobs, and we actually had a Gallup poll where we got very high marks for the job we did. They had a poll where it was so low, it wasn't recordable. And then he's coming along and telling us how to solve this very difficult problem. We've done a great job and I don't want the credit, but I want the people, Mike Pence...
I tell you what, our vice presidentMike Pence, andthe task force, headed up by Mike and working along with a lot of great people, they've done a fantastic job and they just get no credit. If I was a Democrat, a different president, and they did the same job, they'd say it was one of the greatest jobs they've ever seen. But take a look at what they say about the way they handled the swine flu. It was a disaster. It was incompetent. They called themselves incompetent. They called... And now they're coming in like, ""Well, we would have done this,"" and Biden, by the way, was totally against, you remember, xenophobic, racist, because I closed down China.
And then two months later, two and a half, three, and Nancy Pelosi was having dances in Chinatown, right? A month later. No, no problem. I was way ahead. And then Biden comes out and he actually said that I was right, but they said, ""Don't say that, try doing it a little softer than that."" So he did it a little bit softer, but we were right. They were wrong. They handled it so badly. Just take a look, because we, I said to my people, ""We've gotta fight this a little bit differently because we're getting a lot of fake news, a lot of bad people saying things,"" and you look at the stats and you look at how we've done compared to, really, much easier and much smaller countries, it's amazing.
If you took New York out of it, which was a disaster by Cuomo, if you took New York out of those numbers, we would have numbers that would be even better than they are. I could read numbers that would be even much better, because a big percentage of the people that died in this country died because New York was incompetently run by Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. By the way, just today, there's another incredible thing happening. Pfizer, great company, announced that it expects to have the results of its vaccine trials in a matter of weeks, very shortly. Incredible.
Under Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to produce a safe and effective vaccine, in that record time that we talked about. This would have been years later. It'll be delivered before, in my opinion, before the end of the year, but it really might even be delivered before the end of October. How do you like that? Wouldn't that be nice? That would be nice. And you know why? Not because of the election. It'll be nice because we want to save people. That's why it'll be nice. That's the important thing. Together, we will defeat the virus. The job we're doing is... The job that all of the people working on it, our generals, our admirals, the distribution, we bought billions and billions of dollars of things, and now we make gowns and we make masks and we make shields and we make ventilators.
Very tough. The ventilator's very complicated, very big, very expensive. It's like, I made the statement, it's like building a car, but more sophisticated. They said, ""No, it's not."" And they said, they took a ventilator. They took it apart. These people are the worst, the worst. Over the next four years, we'll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That's what we'll do. And let me just tell you something. If they didn't waste a year and a half of my life on a ridiculous impeachment, based on a phone call that was perfect, this stuff would have all been done. Would have all been done. True.
It would have all been done. Yet, with all of this stuff, the fake Russia witch hunt, the fake Ukraine. How about that? Did anybody read the transcript of that call? It was a perfect call. ""Hey, congratulations. Good luck."" It was like a perfect call. Now they'll take it back and they'll say, ""Well, I don't know."" This was a per-... In history, there's never been anything like this. It was a totally lopsided, 100% political witch hunt, and it goes on and on. These are bad people. I really believe they don't love our country. I watched Nancy Pelosi. ""You must wear your mask. You have to wear your mask, and we're gonna keep every beauty salon closed in California and all over the country.""
And then I see a picture. I say, uh, ""Nancy Pelosi. Well, where's the mask?"" I'll tell you what. She must have treated that beauty salon owner pretty badly. She uses the salon and the salon turned her in? The salon turned her in. I don't think I would have turned her in. I would've said, ""Well, you know, she's a customer. I gotta take care of my customers, right?"" But she made them open, and the salon turned her in, and the salon did business with her. How much do they hate Nancy Pelosi? Then she made a terrible mistake because you want people that can't be set up. She said, ""I was set up. I was set up by the salon owner. I was set up.""
I said, ""Tell me she didn't say that, please."" So I just put out, that if she was set up, then she shouldn't be leading the House of Representatives. I want the salon owner to lead the House of Representatives, because she set up... Think of it. She set up the Speaker of the House. That was a big mistake. As soon as I heard, she said, ""Well, she set me up,"" Nancy, you're not supposed to get set up. You're representing our country. You know what she should have done honestly? She should have said, ""I made a mistake, sorry,"" and nobody would be talking about, this is like the biggest story. This is the big... Crazy Nancy, highly overrated person. Let me just say, she is a highly overrated person. They give her such good play. She is a highly overrated person. Look, they just turned off a camera because they don't want me saying that.
So just in closing, we will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assault on law enforcement. Surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities and ban sanctuary cities. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms.
We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens. We will not let them threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. We will end surprise medical billing. We don't want surprise medical billing. You know what happens. It's terrible, but we have ended it. And also, we've signed something that's incredible. You're gonna see. Some people say it's bigger than healthcare, and I signed it. Unfortunately it takes place on January 1st. You better elect me. You better elect me. It's called price transparency.
I said to my people at the end of the day, ""When is price transparency?"" This is gonna lower your prices by 50%. You'll be able to negotiate. You'll be able to do things you're not even allowed to do now, with hospitals, with doctors. You get better doctors, you get lower prices. I said, ""When does it start?"" It's a complicated... Oh, did I get, I was fought. You have no idea. Right, fellows? You were fought too. But they fought me on this price transparency. It's bigger than healthcare, could be bigger than healthcare. But I said, ""When does it start?"" They said, ""Sir, we have it all set."" ""When?"" ""January 1st,"" ""I said, I'd better win this election,"" because you're gonna see some unbelievable price reductions. And that includes on drugs, because we're reducing health insurance premiums massively, and the cost of prescription drugs went down the first time in 51 years, last year.
But now it's going to go down very big, because we did a favored nations clause. I see the drug companies are, they're killing me with ads. They have nothing but cash. They have nothing but money. And they're spending because they can't believe --you know, Germany and other countries pay much less than we do. And we want to have, what we have to have, is we have to have a comparison of prices. And that's what it is called, favored nations clause. I instituted a favored--so we're paying two dollars and 50 cents for a pill, and some nation is paying 10 cents for the same exact pill from the same factory, right? We get the 10-cent price. So, what's going to happen that'll go up. Ours will come way down.
They can't believe it. The drug companies can't believe, and I will tell you, Mark Meadows is here, our Chief of Staff. Where's Mark? They want to negotiate. They called. We signed it. It's all done. They wanna negotiate and they are negotiating, so let's see what happens, but we're gonna get you cuts on prescription drugs, the likes of which you've never seen. We'll protect Medicare and Social Security. They will not be able to protect it. It will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always.
America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. When I took over, NASA was dead. Now it's the most vibrant space center in the world, by far. We will restore patriotic education to our schools, and we'll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ""In God we trust."" For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania.
From Pittsburgh to Harrisburg, from Erie to Easton, and from Bethlehem to right here in Arnold Palmer's beloved Latrobe. I love Arnold Palmer. Arnold, where are you? We love Arnold. There was only one Arnold. We stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. Pennsylvania is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence, right? Declared American independence. Add the word Commonwealth in there. This way, they won't criticize. It's where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, and where General George Washington, who, by the way, they want all of the name, Washington removed from everything.
I haven't been keeping up with it. What did he do? George Washington, they want the name off. Congressmen, are we okay showing... I don't think you like that idea too much. George Washington. They want his name off everything, but we'll keep it. I promise you this. As long as you have cancel culture, you better have a strong president. Cancel culture. George Washington, can you believe it? But he led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. This is the Commonwealth where our union was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg and where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers mined the coal, worked the railroads, forged the steel that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of world. That's in the history of the world and we are making it greater than it's ever been before. That's what's going to happen. Proud citizens like you, helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country from these very, very deranged people. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help and your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving like never before. Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country and together we will work very hard.
The people of Pennsylvania, the great, great people of Pennsylvania, where I went to college. It's a place I know very well. But we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Pennsylvania.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999551177024841,Populist

And as I was saying—Oh, I love that chart, I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing? But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office, it was the lowest border patrol, the lowest it's ever been. Illegal immigration, today it's out of control, but I love it for other reasons too, you know that. So thank you very much and thank Lee, and what Lee has done with that song, and it's such an honor to have it. I want to just let you know that tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America.
Our movement to make America great again, stand stronger, prouder, more united, more determined, and nearer to victory than ever before. We're going to make America great again, going to win the election, going to win the election. And to all Americans, whether you are a Republican, Democrat, Independent, Conservative, or Liberal, or you have no label whatsoever, it makes no difference, our movement, it belongs to you, it belongs to our country, it belongs to our country. And together in just one month, we are going to usher in a new golden age of American security, prosperity, sovereignty, and freedom for our citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
Exactly 12 weeks ago this evening, on this very ground, a cold-blooded assassin aimed to silence me and to silence the greatest movement, MAGA, in the history of our country, MAGA. We love MAGA. For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper's perch, not so far away, but by the hand of Providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close. He did not stop our movement, he did not break out our spirit. He did not shake our unyielding resolve to save America from evils of poverty, hatred, and destruction. Yet we are here this evening in record numbers, this is a big crowd, this is a big one. This is a big one. Not only to mark the triumph of American spirit but over, and you know that, this is really truly in the truest sense, spirit over evil and adversity, but also to pay tribute to some of the best and bravest we have ever known.
This field is now a monument to the valor of our first responders, to the resilience of our fellow citizens, and to the sacrifice of a loving and devoted father, a really great man, you know that. Forever afterward—
Forever after, all who have visited this hallowed place will remember what happened here and they will know of the character and courage that so many incredible American Patriots have showed and know, and they know it at a level never seen before probably. First, I want to thank the men and women of the US Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine—without even a thought for their own lives. They were on top of me so fast, they were on top of me, and there was not even a moment of doubt in their minds. You watch those tapes, not even a moment of doubt, I want to thank Secret Service, great people, they are great people.
And in that moment, those agents displayed a devotion to duty that cannot be described, and they did it yet again, less than three weeks ago when they really did a fantastic job, another attempt, there was another attempt. We have an evil world; we have a very sick world. My gratitude to them is beyond measure. We also owe a tremendous debt thanks to the Secret Service Counter Sniper and a local police sniper—who returned fire within seconds and stopped the shooter quickly and saved many lives. If he didn't stop, he saved many lives, he had a lot of bullets, a lot of ammunition up there with him. And we are—Just amazing when you think they did it so quickly without any knowledge of what was going on, boom. And had that not happened, it would've been a very different story, it would've been many, many, potentially many, many people.
I also want to express our thanks to the Butler Township Police Department, incredible people. The Butler, Sheriff's deputies, Pennsylvania State Police, and all of the other law enforcement heroes, as well as the emergency personnel and doctors, the medical teams at Butler Memorial Hospital, Allegheny General Hospital, who rushed me and rushed some of these very badly wounded people. They were wounded, a lot of badly wounded people, and in particular, two people, two people. And I tell you, they were very brave and great people, they were big Trump fans, and they still are. That means something, that was pretty amazing.
When I got up, I asked whether or not anybody was killed. I assumed that there would be a lot because I heard the bullets winging right over my head. They said probably three, the doctors did such an incredible job. It was one, one great gentleman, but the other two have been amazing actually, they've gone through it, they've gone through a lot. And when the crisis struck, they did really Pennsylvania proud. You've heard that expression, Pennsylvania proud, it's a great place. I went to school, I went to college in Pennsylvania, it's a great place, the people are incredible.
Also, and I have to say, after returning to the field, tonight is one of the really brave Americans who was hit by the assassin's bullet, US Marine Veteran David Dutch. David, thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you, David. And David, we're thrilled to see your recovery is going well. Great doctors up here, I have to tell you, great doctors. Your courage is really an inspiration to us, so I want to thank you very much, David. Great gentleman, great, great gentleman. I want to send our love to someone who could not be here because he has just undergone a major surgery related to the shooting, a man who was really badly wounded like David, James Copenhaver.
Because James was a wonderful man, a big Trump fan, and Mr. Copenhaver is out there watching us right now, but he's in a hospital where they did some additional work, but he's in great shape. He wanted to be here so badly, but he's in great shape and we appreciate it and we're looking to his full and complete recovery, he will have a complete recovery. Thank you. Thank you very much. And of course, there's one more hero who could not make it back here tonight because he is no longer with us, right? You know who that is, right? Corey, our beautiful Corey. Corey is not with us tonight, and he should be, and we all miss him, he's become somewhat of a folk hero. I have to tell you who is with us, is his beautiful wife, and daughters, and relatives, sister. Please, where are you? Where are they sitting? There they are. There's just a lot of people, it's not easy to find people in this audience. Goes back further than you can see. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great family, great incredible family, and he loved you a lot. And you know his wife said something very beautiful. The public, a lot of people, all of us, a lot of people have been very generous, and she said, ""I'd rather have my husband."" That's a good thing to say, that's a good thing to say. ""I'd rather have my husband.""
Corey Comperatore was a incredible husband and father, a devout Christian, a veteran, and a proud former fire chief. Very respected within the town, everybody knew him. Few men volunteered to run into fires, but Corey was one of those who did, he ran into fires. I spoke to people that were with—This guy would do anything. He was brave, right? Brave guy like you, and he was also a protector who put his life on the line for others and he loved doing it. And when the sound of gunshots pierced the air on that July evening, Corey leapt into the fire one more time. In his last seconds of this earth, he threw himself on the top of his wife and daughters, he didn't want them hurt. He threw himself; he knew what was happening, he didn't want them hurt, and he was hit hard, he was hit hard, and he gave his life to shield their lives.
Every father and husband in America hopes that if the time came, we would have what Corey had, tremendous courage, tremendous guts, and he wanted to protect his family, and he did protect his family. At this time, it is 6:11, 12 weeks to the minute that the shooting began. I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.
Wow. Now that is what you call a voice. One of the greatest opera singers in the world, and Christopher Macchio, who's truly a great talent, is going to be back when I leave and I'm going to stay backstage watching every song he's going to sing, three or four great songs, ""Nessun Dorma"" and others. And so I wouldn't leave your seat too fast when we're finished today, but this is in honor of three great people, actually three great and in particular, Corey, and we appreciate it. But that is a real voice, isn't it, huh? That's not—what do you think, Mr. future Vice President, pretty good, right? I don't know if you could do that JD, I don't know. I don't think JD can do that.
In the face of murderous hate, Corey answered, the most selfless kind of love. We are joined this evening by Corey's incredible widow, Helen, his two precious daughters, Kaylee and Allyson. And his sisters, Kelly and Dawn, thank you so much. Thank you so much, this is an incredible tribute. This is a tribute like no other, and he deserves it. To Helen and the entire family, I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief, but I want you to know that just like you, we will carry his memory in our hearts for as long as we live.
Everybody in this stadium and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we are thinking about Corey, we think about him a lot, and I know he's looking down on us right now from heaven smiling at his beloved wife and daughters, and his mother, Karen, and his entire family, his entire family. And—he's with you and he's going to be with us for a long time because some people just don't die in vain, and what he's left behind is incredible, and so God bless you, Corey, God bless you, thank you very much, god bless you.
Just one little story. Helen told me that on the day that they came to the rally, Corey was really excited because somebody gave them great seats right up front here with the people from North Carolina, the ladies from North Carolina. This is their 227th rally, I don't know what's going on with them, those beautiful ladies, but they always seem to have good seats. But Corey had the best seat in the house, and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, ""I'm telling you; he's going to invite me up on the stage."" Because I do that sometimes, I take people, we invite them up in the stage.
And she smiled thinking it'll never happen. And little did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position, and that's where he is today. He's on the stage in a, I think in not almost, I think it's a truly immortal position. So, the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement. The love that our families have, and it's love of our communities and love of our country, it's a force more powerful than any hatred and malice because even in the darkest hours it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us. It guides us really like a candle in the night. And so it's love like Corey's that is joining us to save our country, that's going to heal our country, and that is going to reunite our country as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
So, what our opponents have never understood is that this movement has never been about me, it's always been about you, it's been about a lot of people, millions and millions of people, the biggest ever in the history of this country maybe anywhere. And everyday people who are the heart and soul of our country, they love our movement, they love our country, and they know they're doing right. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day. And now I have a great companion in JD Vance, how good was he the other night? How good? He was great.
He was great. But from the very beginning of this journey, I've been on a mission to rescue our country from a failed and very corrupt political establishment, very corrupt. We have to change it; we have to change it. We need also a very free and open press and to give it back to the country you believe in, and I believe in, it's a country that we were born in and the country that you deserve, you deserve this.
And that mission, I will never quit, I will never bend, I will never break, I will never yield, not even in the face of death itself. And I believe that every citizen deserves an America with a very, very grand ambition, great opportunities, and limitless, we just want limitless potential. We want an America where you can get ahead and be proud of life and provide for your family in a really decent way, where we don't have crime, we have a fabulous military to protect us from evil. Everything has to be the best; we have to have the best schools. We have to have strong borders; we don't want bad people coming in and hurting us. We don't want to have—we don't want to have open borders, do we?
You deserve a government that protects and respects its own citizens, that defends your sovereignty, your security, and your dignity and your freedom. You deserve a nation that builds things again, makes things better, that aims for the stars once more, and that once again commands respect. And we want to get respect like we had it four years ago, the entire world respected us, they respected us. They respected us more than they've ever respected us, and now they laugh at us.
We can't have them laugh at us, can we? Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interest, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, which there are a lot of them, we have a lot of them. We have a lot of them. Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me, but I've never stopped fighting for you, and I never will, never will. Never going to stop.
Thank you. Thank you. And in turn, you have always stood with me. You have always stood with me. No matter what, you saw what was going on, you saw the hoaxes and the scams, you saw everything that went on. We are a team, we're a great team, I think. We're probably the best team ever in the history of our country if you really think about it. We fought together, we have endured together, we have pushed onward together, and right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled together, we bled. We've had three people that really got hit hard, two of them made it, great doctors, great doctors. They weren't supposed to make it, I wasn't supposed to make it. People said -
My great doctor at Butler said, ""Sir, you're the luckiest man alive. This would be a good time for you to go out and buy a lottery ticket. I've never seen anything like—"" I almost went out and bought a lottery ticket, I'll take it. And 31 days from now here in this great commonwealth and all across our land, we are going to win together, we are going to vote together, we're going to win the greatest election in the history of our country, maybe the greatest election all time. After we all have been through all of this together, we have—nobody's gone through what we've gone through, nobody. Because I go through it, you're going through it too, but there's never been anything like this. I always say there's an enemy from within and there's an outside enemy, and if you're smart, the outside enemy is not gonna be a problem. Russia, China, and North Korea, we're not going to have a problem if you have a smart president. If you have not such a smart president, then it's a problem, but we have an enemy from within, which I think is much more dangerous than the outside enemy.
We stand on the verge of the four greatest years in the history of our country, we can make these the four greatest years. We'll turn it around so fast that your head will spin. With victory on November 5th, we are going to redeem America's promise and unlock the extraordinary future that is just within our reach, it is now within our reach. Think of it one month from today, one month. We got to get there; we got to get there. They'll drop all sorts of bombs, they'll be hitting you JD, they'll be hitting me. These people, they'll hit and hit, but I think we've almost become immune to it, haven't we? We've become immune to it, you got a little dose of it, couple of little doses. No, that's, that's the only way they can even think about winning with open borders.
Who wants open borders? Who wants men playing in women's sports? Who wants sex change operations for illegal aliens in holding bins? No, I don't think so. We will begin a new era of soaring income, skyrocketing wealth, millions and millions of new jobs, and a booming middle class. We are gonna boom like we've never boomed before, and we're going to unleash a manufacturing renaissance right here in Pennsylvania, including fracking like we've never fracked before. We're going to frack, frack, frack. Our opponent said, ""There'll be no fracking, no fracking, we'll never frack, we'll never frack."" Then about when she started seeing poll numbers, by the way. And by the way, speaking of poll numbers, do you mind if I mentioned poll numbers? Because I only mentioned them when they're good. I'd never mentioned it. But one that's hit me really amazingly, Rasmussen, very highly respected poll. JD, it just came out. I don't think you heard this one, but this is a shocker. They always say the Democrats will win the Hispanic vote, but we've been creeping up rather rapidly. And Rasmussen is one of the most respected polls. I mean, Republicans would get 4, 5, 6, 9, 10%. They just came out with a poll, 62% for Trump. Think of that. Think of that.
And 34% for Kamala. I don't usually use her last name. Nobody knows who I'm talking about. I go, ""Harris, Harris."" They say, ""Who's Harris?"" It's happening all the time. Who's Harris? And we can't find out who she is because if we do, our country is gonna be in big trouble. We will live in a very beautiful city or town that are safe and clean with borders that are sealed and secure.
And again, we want people to come into our country. We all want that. We need that. But you know what? We want it to come in legally. They're going to come in legally and love for our country. And America will once again be strong, and confident, and free. We're going to have that. We're going to have it strong, confident, and free. That's why I'm here today. I could right now be having a beautiful life. I don't have to be here. Instead, I could be on a gorgeous beach someplace. I have such nice property.
I could be, I could be in Monte Carlo as an example, but I'd rather be in Butler with you. I would rather. I'd rather be in Butler. And I think JD would rather be in Butler. JD?
No, I'd rather be here because we're doing something. They get a lot of rich guys that go, ""Nobody cares about him.""
I had one about a month ago, very, very rich guy, and he called me up. He said, ""President—"" I've known him for a long time. I don't say how long because I don't want my wife to hear that number. It's a long time. But he's very successful. And he said to me, ""Sir, could you do me a favor?"" Guy's worth billions of dollars. He said, ""Could you do me a favor? I can't get into a restaurant. Do you think you could call them to get me in?"" And I said, ""What the hell is the good of being rich if you can't get into a restaurant?""
And I called the maître d', ""Hi,"" I'm a little embarrassed, ""Hi, this is Trump."" ""I recognize your voice."" I said, ""Would you do me a favor? A friend of mine is online about a mile back. This is a very successful restaurant. And he's got his wife."" I describe the wife. ""Could you possibly go get them? Could you go get them and bring them in?"" And he did. And my friend called me up the next day. He said, ""Thank you very much. Thank you.""
Oh. Doctor, please? Doctor, in the house? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, doctor.
Take your time, doctor please. We got plenty of time, right?
We got a lot of time.
You're doing okay? -Take your time.
We've got to protect our people, right? Take your time.
It's all right, doctor. Go ahead. That's all right. That's all right. People come out two, three days ago and then they get—It's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing. We appreciate—Everybody appreciates it. Yep. Take your time. That's great. That's great.
Do we have the greatest people in the world? We have the greatest people in the world.
First responders, thank you very much.
O say can you, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.
And the rocket's red glare, the bomb bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there,
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Thank you.
Thank you, doctor. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you all. Fellas, thank you. First responders, thank you very much.
People are here for a long time, and we appreciate it very much. And so sometimes that happens. A lot of times that happens actually. But you'll be great, you watch. So, 12 weeks ago, we all took a bullet for America and all we are all asking is that everyone goes out and votes. We got to win. We can't let this happen to our country. We can't take another four years like this. We won't have a country left. We're not gonna have a country left. And all of this will be for nothing if you don't get out and vote. It will all be for nothing. We will have talked about it but -and if we do it'll be the greatest achievement, I think in the history of politics for all of us for this age because we're going to change our country around and fast.
We're gonna do things that nobody thought were possible. We're gonna do them fast. So Pennsylvania's time to stand up for America and time to save our country. This is really about saving our country. It's never been like this. When you look at the crime, look at the crime, look at the people that are coming in. Murderers. 13,099 murderers let in over the last short period of time.
Murderers that have been released from penitentiaries, prisons, jails, released into our country. Crime rates all over the world are down. They're taking their gang members and their criminals. They're taking their people in jail and they're releasing them into our country. We can't have it. You know, we just can't have it. How do you get more simple than that? They're releasing murderers. They're releasing drug dealers. They're releasing gang members and criminals. Human traffickers. Mostly they traffic in women and they're releasing them all into our country, and they're emptying their jails. And their crime rates in Venezuela are way down because you know—But it's not only in South America, it's all over the world. And Africa, the Congo.
A lot of people coming out of the Congo in Africa. They're coming out from Asia. They're coming out from the Middle East, Yemen. They're coming out from Yemen. A lot of people coming out of Yemen, and they're known terrorists, and they just release them into our country from countries unknown also. They know nothing about the people. They'll go right in. These people are crazy. And we have to win. We'll stop it immediately and we'll have to—Look, it will be a big deportation.
We're going to deport these people. We're going to get them out of our country immediately. Or we won't have a country. And if we win Pennsylvania, we will win the whole thing. The whole thing will be won. So for the sake of our families, for the sake of our children, we will keep on going. And as the expression goes, I mean, I'm a little embarrassed to say it, to be honest you, but I'm going to say it because a lot of people do say it, we will fight, fight, fight.
Going to fight for our country. We're going to fight for our country.
And together we will save this country. We will restore the republic and America's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer and greater and more united than ever before. Our country will be united. You'll watch, you'll watch. We had the most successful country ever, maybe in the world during my term. We are the greatest economy that we've ever had. And you know what was happening? We were uniting the other side, radical left. People were coming over. They wanted to meet. They were coming over. Women, men. If you look at population, our black population, our Hispanic population, our Asian population, everybody was doing better.
People that went to the best schools and best colleges in the world got the highest marks. And people that couldn't get a high school degree, everybody was doing better. And our country was coming together. And then we got hit with COVID, a gift from China. Some people would call it the China virus. And we did a great job on that too. We did a great job. But the world was disturbed.
$60 trillion in damage worldwide. Millions and millions, tens of millions of people killed, and we still during this four-year period, we had the greatest economy. One of the great countries of the world. And we left with the stock market that was higher than it was just prior to COVID coming in. So what we did was something really incredible. But we had the greatest, most successful country ever. We had the greatest economy in our history and we're going to do it again. And maybe even better. We learned a lot. We learned a lot about people and about doing things, and what works, and what doesn't work. And we're going to do it. And it's going to be quick. It's going to be quick.
And we're going to have safe cities, and we're going to have great cities again. And we're going to have a capital in Washington, DC which is right now crime-ridden. You leave from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; you go drive down to Washington DC and you drive down, and you end up getting murdered. You end up getting hurt, you get mugged. We are going to straighten out Washington DC. We're going to make it again, the most beautiful capital in the world.
We're not going to have graffiti. We're not going to have graffiti on our marble columns. We're not going to have roads that have potholes all over them and medians that are falling into the highways. We're going to run it properly. We're going to change it. We're going to run it properly. It's an embarrassment to us. Can you imagine foreign leaders coming in and running over roads that haven't been paved in years? We're honored to be joined tonight by one of the people who is going to help us build this incredible future. And he is a truly incredible guy. And I don't say that that often.
He's a great gentleman. He's done such an unbelievable job for North Carolina, for Georgia, for Alabama, for Florida, for Tennessee. His name is Elon Musk. He saved free speech. He created so many different great things. Where is he? Come on up here, Elon. He created the first major American car company in generations. And his rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. Come here. Take over, Elon. Yes, take over.
ELON MUSK: Hi, everyone. As you can see, I'm not just MAGA, I'm dark MAGA. Well, first of all, I want to say what an honor it is to be here. And you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire. We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot. Fight, fight, fight. Blood coming down the face.
MUSK: Now America is the home of the brave. And there's no truer test than courage under fire. So who do you want representing America?
MUSK: Yeah, absolutely. And I think this election, I think it's the most important election of our lifetime. This is no ordinary election. The other side wants to take away your freedom of speech. They want to take away your right to bear arms. They want to take away your right to vote effectively. You got 14 states now that don't require voter ID. California, where I used to live, has just passed the law, banning voter ID for voting. I still can't believe that's real. So how you supposed to have a good proper election, if there's no ID. It's just meaningless. And free speech, free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it's the First Amendment. And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. President Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.
MUSK: Yes. This is a must-win situation, must win. So I have one ask for everyone in the audience, everyone who watches this video, everyone in the live stream, there's one request. It's very important. Register to vote. Okay? And get everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, you drag them to register to vote. There's only two days left to register to vote in Georgia and Arizona. 48 hours. Like, text people now, now. And then make sure they actually do vote.
If they don't, this will be the last election. That's my prediction. Nothing is more important. Nothing is more important. So get everyone you know. So I'm speaking to people out there. Everyone in the crowd I think is already convinced. But for people out there that are watching the video, watching the live stream, you need to get everyone you know at work, your friends, family, text groups, your social media, everything, get them to register to vote right now. Only two days left for Georgia and Arizona. Only a couple of weeks left in Pennsylvania. And if they're not registered to vote, it doesn't matter at that point. Register to vote. I'm being repetitive for a reason. So nothing is more important. And a lot of people think maybe their vote doesn't count. Well, it does. Okay? It does. It matters. And this election could be decided by a thousand votes, 500 votes, a tiny margin. So get everyone you know to register to vote. I believe it's swampthevote.com. I believe that's the site. Double check that your registration is good. Don't take it for granted.
I'm just being repetitive about this point because it is the one takeaway more than anything that will matter is getting those registrations and then getting everyone you know to actually vote. That is what will decide this election, especially in Pennsylvania. So thank you. And honestly, you want to just be a pest. Just be a pest to everyone you know. People on the street, everywhere. Vote, vote, vote. Fight, fight, fight. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you.
What a great guy. And he'd rather be making rocket ships because he'd really rather do that. Nobody better. I think he's got 90% of the rockets that go up. But Elon, thank you very much. Incredible, incredible. What he says is true. What he says is true. We're all having fun here tonight. But if we don't register and if we don't vote, we're just going to look upon this as another sort of nice day in our life. But it won't even be a nice day. We're going to look back and we're going to say, ""Wow, it's a lot of time, a lot of effort. We got to win."" If we don't win, it's as he said, it's just not important. We have to save our country. So you have to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. You got to get your friends and vote because they play a lot of tricks this particular other side.
Elon is a very nice guy. He doesn't want to say it, but they play a lot of tricks. We can't let it happen. We can't let it happen again. We can't let it happen. And one thing, they showed us how bad they are, they showed us how bad a job they do. So that's one thing we got from this four years. They've done the worst job. It's the worst president in the history of our country. It's the worst vice president in the history of our country. And if you watched over the last couple of days, they are doing—This is a Katrina for them.
This is one of the worst. They say it's the worst job ever done on helping people through the ravages of a hurricane. And they're watching—She's out there, out there campaigning in San Francisco, a place that she ruined. Okay? She ruined. She ruined San Francisco. She ruined—Think of this. She ruined San Francisco. She was the worst DA. And she ruined the state of California, and now she wants to ruin the United States of America. We can't let her do it.
So, I called Elon to tell him that they needed Starlink as an example. They couldn't get Starlink. I didn't know what Starlink was. I must tell you. Elon, I'm so embarrassed. I didn't know what the hell Starlink was. He loves Starlink. He can tell you every little screw that's needed, every wire. Me, I didn't know. But when I was in North Carolina and Georgia just the other day, yesterday to be exact, but they were saying, we have tremendous communications especially in North Carolina. And we have tremendous problems. We have no communication. The poles were ripped down, the wires were underwater, houses were destroyed.
Possibly a thousand people. Maybe more will be. There's 600 people missing. Missing is not good. Because you know what missing means generally. That's really bad. And they had no communication. They had literally no communication with, they called it the mainland because the water was so crazy. It was like they were in the middle of a lake, and they'd never seen anything like it. And they said, ""Do you know somebody named Elon Musk?"" I said, ""Yeah, I happened to know him a little bit. He just endorsed me actually.""
Well, he endorsed me a long time ago, but he still—To me, every day is a good endorsement from Elon. Nobody is smarter than Elon. And they said, ""Could you do us a favor? Could you help us? We're trying to get Starlink and it's very hard to get. Most people say you can't even get it."" I called up Elon. I said, ""North Carolina is in big trouble. Georgia is in big trouble. They need communication."" They have none because their poles have been knocked down and their wires are underwater and even dangerous. dangerously underwater. But they have no communication. Elon, could you do something about Starlink? Whatever the hell that is, Elon. Whatever, Starlink. That's all they want to hear is Starlink.
And an amazing thing happened. I got a call from one of the top people in North Carolina. I got a call from another great person in Georgia. And I wasn't finished with my phone call yet, and they got word that Starlink would be delivered to the States. I said—No. And I said, ""What the hell is he—What kind of a system is that? Normally you'd have to hang up and he'd go and call people."" He did it during the phone call. What kind of a system do you have? That's why he's a very advanced, he is a very advanced person, but I want to thank you, Elon because I got it. And I said, ""How does it work? Two days later, how does it work?"" They said, ""Much better than the wires.""
So now I'm saying, ""Why the hell aren't they—You're going to come out very well anyway."" And he also said, ""You don't have to pay me. You pay someday when you get the money back. You don't have to pay me."" He wanted nothing. He's a great guy. Thank you, Elon, for being here. Thank you very much. Great honor, great honor.
Thank you, Elon. And that's heartfelt. I can't even see the end. That's a lot of people here today. We're also joined by a great gentleman, a top, top, brilliant student. He went to a tremendous college, and he graduated right at the top of his class in two years. I didn't know you could do, that's four-year college. Then he went to the military then he came out and he did fantastically inside the military. Then he came out, he went to Yale without the benefit of family ties. You know what that means? Right? That's pretty good without family ties. I don't know too many of those people. They had no family ties. He got in. He can't get in, and he graduated along with his wife. They're not going to have any problems with your kids academically. I can tell you.
His wife and him were like the top students in the class. But he went to Yale Law School and then he went out into the private sector, did great. Then he ran for the senate, and he did fantastically. He won. And he's like a rocket ship. He's like one of Elon's rocket ships the way his career is going. But you see why? Because he's a really brilliant guy. And you saw that the other night in the debate. Right? You saw that the other night in the debate. You know the expression they have? If that were a fight, they would've stopped it. Right?
So, I just want to thank JD. I was always confident in that pick. And we had great people too, JD. Every—Every one of those guys were great. Every one of them would have done a great job. It was amazing. But we appreciate the job you're doing. He's also very energetic, and he'll go on anywhere. He'll go on MSDNC. I say, ""Oh, he's done that."" He'll go on CNN. He has no problem. He swats them like this. He has no problem. No, it's true. Other people say, ""Sir, I'd rather not do that one. I'd rather not do that one, sir. I'd rather not do them,"" because they are very—With him, he doesn't care. He says, ""They're not going to outsmart me."" So, I want to thank JD. You've done a great job. Thank you very much. Amazing. Great.
We have a lot of senators and a lot of people from Congress. I'm going to introduce a few of them that are really outstanding, and they are warriors and they're great Patriots. Senator Eric Schmitt. Where's Eric Schmitt? He's around here someplace. Nice, tall, handsome guy. Thank you, Eric. What a great job you've done. He helps us so much with the Senate, and we've got a great Senate. We have to get a couple of more senators elected. I think it's going to happen, too. I think it's going to happen.
We have members of Congress here, Dan Meuser. Dan? Where's Dan? Great, great job. Real warrior. These are warriors. Guy Reschenthaler. That's the hardest name in the Senate to pronounce, but I've learned how to pronounce it. Guy, thank you very much. Great. Where's Guy? Guy? Thank you very much, Guy? Glenn G.T. Thompson. Fantastic guy. Thanks, Glenn. Great job. John Joyce. Thank you, John. Great. Cory Mills. He's out there fighting, too. He's out there. He is out there in North Carolina, Georgia. He's out there helping people.
Mike Waltz, who's a tremendous national security asset. Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. Okay. And a man who was my doctor, I got to know him as a doctor in the White House, right. And then before that, he was actually an Admiral. And then he went to the White House. He was a great Admiral. He was a great doctor, and I love him for one reason. They asked him in the White House. The press, the fake news media said, ""Who is the most—"" He was the doctor for Obama, Bush, and Trump. That's pretty good, right? White House doctor for the three of us.
He said, the press, ""Who is the healthiest of the three?"" He said, ""Definitely, it's Donald Trump. There's not even a contest."" And I love that guy. JD, when he said that, I said, ""I like this guy."" So then he said, ""You know, sir?"" He was leaving the White House. He said, ""You know, I'd love to run for Congress."" He ran against 28 people. They were all running for the Republican primary because whoever won that primary is going to win. I think it's a Trump plus 48. Whoever wins gets 48-point start.
And not only did he win, he won easily, and now he's one of the most popular people in Congress and one of the most talented, maybe more importantly. Ronny Jackson. Ronny? Where is Ronny? Where is you? Oh, good. Thank you, Ronny. You got a lot of talent surrounding you there. I think it's very important, also. We're here for a reason, and that's to win and to honor Corey, but Corey wants us to win, too.
There's a man in the audience that's been very much a career path a little bit like JD, great student, great, talented student, and fantastic in the military, then went out to be a tremendous success, one of the most successful people on Wall Street, actually. And he's tough, and he's smart. He's going to make sure you always have fracking in Pennsylvania, and he's going to make sure you have many other things other than fracking.
You have a senator that now does nothing. He does nothing, and he doesn't fight for you. He votes with Biden, if you can believe it, 100% of the time. But this guy, we're lucky that he does it. I don't know. He might not have done it if he had it to do again. I don't know. But I think he's just one of the most outstanding people anywhere in the country to run for office, and we're lucky that he's doing it. And he's got a real shot. He's doing very well in the polls.
It's hard to beat somebody that's been there a long time, but this is somebody that's been there a long time and did nothing. He did nothing. His name is David McCormick, and he's great and I hope he's going to be your next senator. I see somebody else. I didn't know he was here. Mike Kelly. I see Mike Kelly here. Stand up. Oh, boy, am I lucky. Am I lucky I spotted him. If I didn't spot you, Mike, I was in big trouble, right? This is a man who's beloved in this state, and he's fantastic. So thank you, Mike. Thank you.
We also have some terrific people from law enforcement, Butler County Sheriff Mike Slupe. Thank you, Mike. Great job. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thank you for your help, too. I could tell you. Thank you for your help. I can say that. Thank you very much. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Osche. Leslie, thank you. Thank you, Leslie. Great job. RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, this guy is doing a great job. He's doing great. Came from North Carolina. We won North Carolina.
He kept their cheating down to a minimum, and we were able to win it. We were solid all night long. He's great, but if we don't have good results by the 6th of November, I will never say that about him again. No, he's a great guy. He's working very hard. 24 hours a day, he's working. I know that. He's working mostly on Stop the Steal because we have a lot of votes. We have plenty of votes. Stop the Steal. That's why you've got to get out. You've got to get out and vote. We're going to win this thing.
The more we win it, it's too big to rig, the expression we use. Make it too big to rig. Elon would understand this better than anybody. Statistically, at a certain point, their cheating doesn't matter. We want to make it too big to rig. We also have somebody that's very special, the co-chair of the Republican Party, Lara Trump. Thank you. Lara, thanks.
And you know, oftentimes with families, they say, ""Oh, why did you put that one in or this one in?"" And all the different people, so many people have problems with that. In her case, everyone said, ""How the hell did you get her to do it? She has been unbelievable."" So, thank you very much. Comes from North Carolina, and I have a feeling she's going to be spending some time down there a little bit. And she's married to my wonderful son, Eric, who's right here. So, Eric, please stand up. He's a great guy.
Eric has a distinction. He has gotten more subpoenas than any man in the history of our country by about 10 times. Every day Congress would meet, they'd send him a subpoena. What is it about? They have no idea. But I think he's got the all-time record, and he's handled it all beautifully. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. A friend of mine, a great, great businessman, one of the most respected people, and he made a big, big contribution yesterday to Georgia and a big contribution to North Carolina. Steve Witkoff is here. Hi, Steve. Thanks.
And another man who's one of the greatest businessmen in the country, he actually said that ""If Trump doesn't win, this country is going to go into a massive depression."" Well, I don't know about that, but he has been a very good predictor, I will say that, and truly one of the greats, one of the great pickers, picker meaning stocks. He knows what he's doing and highly respected by everybody. John Paulson. Thank you, John. Great. Great guy.
Now, we have so many others, and I won't do it because we have to really get out of here before it gets too cold for people, but I just—I love it much better because there's one teleprompter, not that I use the teleprompters too much. Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter? No, we don't need it. We don't need it. But this one was right smack in the sun. Great job back there, fellas. They said, ""The teleprompters are working fine."" Well, thank goodness.
Did you see what happened the other day with the teleprompter with her? That was not a pretty sight. The teleprompter went off, and she went off, too. She didn't know what the hell happened. And you know, teleprompters are very dangerous because they go off a lot. You have to be prepared for them to go off, cold blank. You'll have 100,000 people. You have 75,000 people. You have this. If the teleprompter goes off, you got to be able to move. She did not move well. This was not a good situation.
But three more heroes from July 13 who rendered first aid to Corey incredibly, Dr. Jim Sweetland, Rico Elmore, who was unbelievable. Rico, you were unbelievable. He ran over National Guard. He ran over and grabbed Corey, and Corey was still living. He was doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a man who was really in bad shape like nobody's ever seen. His family appreciates it, and I do, too. So thank you, Rico, very much. Right? Amazing, amazing.
Amazing the people that we have. You learn about them under times like this. That's when you really learn. So we're going to be seeing Rico again. Ed Shear, fantastic job. Thank you, Ed. We appreciate it. Thank you, Ed. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ed. Great job. In addition, this evening, we have to send our prayers and support to all the families affected by Hurricane Helene. This has been the worst hurricane response by a president and vice president since Katrina, and this is simply not acceptable.
Those people, I was there yesterday with North Carolina and Georgia. I'll tell you. By the way, the governor of Georgia is doing an excellent job, excellent job. But we have other people that aren't doing a good job, and we have to have them do a good job. But the federal government is doing a very bad job. They are not doing the job, and we have death and destruction that we haven't seen maybe ever. It's a real bad one. They have to get people there because they don't have people there. They don't have the people.
Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina, no helicopters, no rescue. It's just what's happened there is very bad. They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They're offering them $750. They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed. The one young lady washed—You saw that with her son. I wish I never saw it, but just washed away. Your son was washed away with the grandparents. So sad.
They're offering them—giving them $750. Think of it. We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars, and we're handing North Carolina $750. If you want a president who won't even try to save you when the floodwaters are rising, vote for Kamala. She's not the right person. Look, you know what? If they were—if they did a good job, I wouldn't have run, to be honest with you. I didn't need to do this. I didn't need to. If I thought they were doing an even modestly good job, I wouldn't have run.
But I saw right from the beginning, grossly incompetent, and I was right about that. I decided to run, and we're doing really well. I was telling you about polls. We're way up in some polls. We're up in other polls. And with the swing states, I think most of them have us up in every single swing state, including the great commonwealth of a place called Pennsylvania. Don't ever not call it a commonwealth because I've seen people call it a state, and that's the end of them. That's practically the end of their political career.
You got to be very careful with Pennsylvania. It's that commonwealth. I haven't made that mistake. I don't want to either. It was not a pretty picture. If you want a president who will stop at nothing to protect you and your family, I hope you're going to vote for a gentleman named Donald J. Trump. Have you heard of him? Together, we will rebuild western North Carolina, rural Georgia, and every other state that's been so badly affected. That includes Alabama.
Virginia was very hit hard. South Carolina was hit very hard, Florida, so many states, Tennessee was hit really hard. They were all hit, and we're going to work with them. And you know, the next president is going to be the one that really once they get—They got to get this done. But once that happens, the next president is going to be the one that has to really help them. JD will be there to help them. I know that.
2024 is the most important election in the history of our country, and here are the facts. My opponent, Kamala Harris, is the most incompetent and far-left nominee ever to run for president. You know, she's much further left than crazy Bernie Sanders. You know that. She wants to open borders. She took the most secure border in US history and turned it into the worst border in the history of the world. Remember, she was appointed border czar. She says she wasn't now after three years, but she was. But whether she was or not, she was in charge of the border.
And the other day I saw her get up and say, ""We will do this. We will do that."" Why didn't they do it four years ago? Why didn't they do it? The damage is so bad and so—It's been done. She let in 21 million illegal aliens from all over the world, from prisons and jails and mental institutions and insane asylums. There are terrorists at record levels, at levels we've never seen before.
She costs you $29,000 a family through inflation price hikes, and now she wants a larger tax hike in—She wants to go to the largest tax hike in American history. There's never been a tax hike like what she's proposing. She's going to raise your taxes a minimum of $3,000. She's a big taxer, and she was the original creator of Defund the Police. I think for all the sheriffs over here, if you're a partner in Defund the Police for even two days, you cannot be president.
But she was one of the founders of Defund the Police, and she still believes that, by the way. I don't know how anybody could, but she still believes that. If she ever had a chance, there's a good possibility she'd go back to it. Can you imagine somebody's robbing our house? Well, there's nothing we can do about it. They tried it. You know where they tried it? In Minnesota with our vice president and it wasn't working out too well. It was working out very well for the robbers and the criminals. That's the only one it was working out well for.
Kamala Harris vowed to abolish ICE. She wants mass amnesty and citizenship for illegals. And worst of all—This is maybe the worst thing in the whole—that nobody talks. The fake news won't mention it. She lost more than 325,000 migrant children that are now dead, in slavery, or just plain missing, probably never to be seen again, never to see their parents again. But this isn't like—This is 325,000 have been lost.
She praised the idea of a 70% to an 80% tax rate. She imposed a natural gas export ban on Pennsylvania, which is killing your energy workers and your pricing. You know, you have one of the highest energy costs in the country, and yet you're sitting on top of a massive amount of energy that she doesn't want to get. It's been a disaster for your state. Now she's vowed repeatedly, now all of a sudden, she changed her mind.
With politicians, it's always the first statement that comes out to be the one they want. So she's spent 14 years knocking fracking. ""We're never going to have fracking. We're not going to frack."" All of a sudden, a little while ago, she came out, ""I love fracking very much."" No, she'll go back to it. And she even endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention at taxpayer expense. I don't think Elon likes that idea. These are not ideas that Elon Musk likes too much.
And it was just announced yesterday in California. He took this one from me. I'm so upset. But think of it, that the far less than average governor, Gavin Newscum, has banned any and all ID requirements from voting and registering to vote. You're not even allowed to mention the fact, Elon. You're not allowed to mention the fact. You can't say, ""May I see your ID?"" If you do, it's a criminal act. This like—this is a takeover of the country. You're not allowed to ask for an ID. If you do, it's a criminal count.
Other Democrat states are following. This is only so they can cheat. There's only one thing that you do this for, so that you can cheat on elections. There's no other conceivable reason. Kamala Harris is a radical left Marxist. She is a woman that's not respected in Congress. She was laughed at at Congress. Nobody thought she could win. They did a coup of Biden, whether you like him or not. I'm not a particularly big fan.
But we had a debate, and debate ended. And all of a sudden, they come to him, and they say, ""We want you out. You're not going to win the election."" He said, ""I don't want to get out."" He got 14 million votes, if you believe in democracy or the system. He got 14 million votes, and she got none. She was the first one out, 22 candidates, and she never made it to Iowa. She quit before Iowa, and now she's running. And that's okay. But we spent $150 million beating Biden.
As soon as he was down and out for the count, they say, ""Let's take him out. We'll get somebody else to run."" Never happened before. We do a lot of firsts. I will tell you. We do a lot of firsts. But she's a person that rated even worse in every statistic than any other senator. She was rated at the bottom of the US Senate. She's destroyed everything she touched, but the good news is that we have a plan to fix it. We're going to fix it, and we're going to fix it fast.
Nobody is going to stand for open borders. Nobody is going to stand for a bad military. Nobody is going to stand for education that's not proper. We're moving education back to the states. You're going to be running your own—Education is so important. What's more important than education? But we rank at the bottom of every list. They rank 40 major countries. We're at the bottom, but we're top of the list as the cost per pupil.
We spend more per pupil, per student, than any other country anywhere in the world. So, we're number one in that, and we're number 38, 39 or 40 every single time. And you have Denmark. You have Sweden. You have Norway. You have China's always the top five. Can you believe it? China's the top five. That's amazing. But we're going to move our education back to the states, so places like Indiana and Iowa and Idaho and states that you don't even hear too much of because they're so good and so well-run, they're going to run their own education. You know what's going to come out of that? A Denmark, a Norway, a Sweden. Maybe, I don't even know, China. Can you imagine? China with 1.4 billion people is a top five and we're close to 40. We are 40 sometimes.
Starting on day one, I will seal the border and stop the migrant invasion into our country. We will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. Dwight Eisenhower right now has that record.
And by the way, it's not something I want to do. I dread having to do it, but we have no choice. What they've done to our country is not even believable, especially the criminals, the criminal element that's in our country. And again, all over the world, crime rates are down because they've taken their criminals, and they've dumped them into the United States. And you know what? I would have been worse than them. I would have had it done even faster.
They've dumped them into the United States of America, and that's what we have. It's dangerous out there. We're getting them out. We're getting them out quickly. We will defeat inflation, and we will make America affordable again. It's going to start with liquid gold. We have more liquid gold, oil and gas, under our feet than any nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia and Russia.
We will become energy-independent like we were just four years ago. Four years ago, we were energy independent. Can you believe it? And then we were going to become energy-dominant. We will be dominant within a matter of months, and we will make so much money. We are going to drill, baby, drill. We will again open ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to do it. Every single president from before Reagan tried to do it, and I got it done.
ANWR is the largest drilling site anywhere in the world. It could be larger than Saudi Arabia. It could be larger than Russia. It's in Alaska. I got it done, and we worked to get it done. One of the first things he did was terminate ANWR, and that was going to take care of all of Asia. That was going to make us so much money. We would have paid off debt. I gave you the biggest tax reduction in history. You would have gotten even a bigger one. You were going to be just very happy. You were going to say, ""I like that guy very much.""
20 million Americans are behind on their electric bills right now. It was just announced. 20 million Americans, they're struggling to pay their monthly bills at a record rate. There's never been anything like it. And it's all because of their anti-US energy regime, which has caused Pennsylvania electricity prices to raise almost 50%. We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months.
We will have your prices, your air conditioning, heating, cars if you buy a Tesla, which is good. Woo, it's good. We will have your energy prices cut in half. It'll be cut in half within a period of one year from January 20th, which is the day we take office. That's going to save you a lot of money. That's going to bring down the prices of everything because more than anything else, people tell me about the groceries, the groceries, our groceries.
And what they're talking about is food. Everything's going to be coming down when we do that. We're also going to get your interest rates way down. We will bring automobile manufacturing back to the United States at levels never seen before, and we will turn the United States into a manufacturing superpower again. It hasn't been there in many, many years. We had it started four years ago.
The centerpiece of my plan for a manufacturing renaissance will be a 15% made-in-America corporate tax rate. In other words, if you make your product in the United States, you get a rate. So, I cut it from 39% to 21%. Everyone said that was impossible. I got it done, and we had the best boom we've ever had. We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39. Think of it. Much more. The following year we did much more.
And then I'm going to take it from 21 to 15, which will make us the most competitive country in the world. Nobody will be able to compete with us. But that 15 rate only goes for those who make their product in America. They have to make their product here, otherwise, they pay 21. We will protect those companies moving into America, and all of our existing companies, with stiff tariffs placed on companies that don't move in.
If they don't come in, if they don't want to make their product here, that's fine, but they're going to be tariffed. We have to protect our companies, and that's what we're going to do. The only way they can get out of paying those tariffs is to build their plants and factories in America. We may even be able to get Elon to build some of them. I think we will. And hire American workers for the job. We're gonna hire American workers for the job.
We will pass the Reciprocal Trade Act. If China or any other country charges us 100 or 200% tax, then we will likewise charge them a 100 or 200% tax. We had a lot of problems on that one with the Senate, and we're going to get that done. Think of it. They charge us, and we don't charge them. Now, they charge us. We're going to charge them the same thing, reciprocal. It's reciprocal.
I will not let Mexico, China, or any other country sell cars into the United States to the detriment of our auto workers who will better than they have ever done. We're going to bring back the car business like it was 50, 60, and 70 years ago. Everyone's going to want to be back here. I will not approve Japan buying US Steel, 70 years ago, the greatest company anywhere in the world. It was the greatest company anywhere in the world, and now we have Japan buying US Steel. I don't like that.
We will deliver massive tax cuts for workers, and we will have a policy that I think is so great, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors, no tax. When you think of it, our seniors were hurt so badly. Inflation has killed our seniors. They have a fixed income, and it just got worse and worse every week. Every month, it's gotten worse and worse, and it's just horrible. They haven't gone down. They've only gone up. Prices have still only gone up.
While working Americans catch up, we're going to put a temporary cap on the credit card interest rates at 10%. People are paying 28% interest, 25% interest. I will always protect Social Security and Medicare with no cuts. We're not going to do anything with Social Security, but they're going to destroy Social Security because all of the migrants coming in are going on between Medicare, Social Security, other programs, and nobody is able to afford it.
I will settle the war in Ukraine. I will end the chaos in the Middle East, and I will prevent, I promise you, World War III. We're not going to have World War III. Right now, we're very close to having it. We will lead the world in space exploration. Thank you, Elon. We will lead the world in military, and we will reach Mars before the end of my term. Elon promised me he was going to do that. I don't know. Can you do that? Stand up. Can we do that?
I think he's going to do it. JD, work on him. Work on him. Work on him. JD is working on Elon. No, he told me that we're going to win, and he's going to reach Mars by the end of our term, which is a big thing, before China, before anybody. And my money's on that guy right there.
We will rebuild our cities, including Washington, D.C., making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. And we will keep the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. It's losing right now. It's losing right now. But I'll be able to do it. Other people won't. I'll tell these countries, as they leave us on the—I say, ""You want to do business in the United States? You're going back into the reserve currency. And if you don't, we're going to charge you a big, fat, beautiful tax to do business in the United States."" And they're going to say, ""I would love very much to go back into the US reserve currency."" No, we're going to save it. But these people aren't going to save it. They don't know how to talk. They don't know how to think.
Together, we will deliver low taxes, low regulations, low energy costs, low interest rates, and low inflation, so that everyone can afford groceries, a beautiful car, and a home. Very basic. It's very basic. We will stop the invasion, end migrant crime, strengthen our military, build a missile defense shield around our country, keep critical race theory and transgender insaniticy, we're going to keep it the hell out of our school. We're going to keep that insanity out of our school. And as I said, we will keep men out of women's sports. So demeaning to women.
You saw that in the Olympics. They have female boxing, women's boxing, and a young lady from Italy, very good boxer, very, very good. She was all excited. But she played a person who transitioned, person transitioned, a male transitioned to a female, and the young girl from Italy, beautiful young woman, I'm not allowed to say that anymore politically, but I'll say it, she was a beautiful young woman. If you say that, that's the end of your career, right? But it's not. If it is, so be it, okay? We've got to get back to real life. But this beautiful young lady is out, and she gets, boom, a little jab, left jab, and she goes back, ""Oh my God, I've never been hit like that. This is just like a defensive."" Then he goes, the corner said, ""You can take her!"" So, they push her out. Boom, another one. And she says, ""That's enough, I can't do it. I can't take it."" I've never seen anything like it. So, we had two people that transitioned. Both people, shockingly, won the gold medal in their division. So, it's crazy.
And if you look at weightlifting contests, they're the best of all. For years and years and years ago, they put an eighth of a pound on one side of the barbell, an eighth of a pound on the other. And they can't do it! And the record's standing for 18 years, they just can't do it. And then a guy comes along who never lifted before, and he puts a hundred pounds on, and he goes like this], like it's nothing. It's so demeaning to women. We're not going to allow it to happen. It's ending. No men playing in women's sport.
And we will defend the Second Amendment, protect religious liberty, restore free speech, and we will secure our elections. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. We need hope. We need the American Dream back, don't we? We're going to have the American Dream. We're going to have the American Dream, so every kid in your family is going to grow up and say, ""I want to be like Elon Musk. I want to have $200 billion in cash. I'm going to be like Elon Musk."" Get to it. That's the American Dream.
But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris, and we must stop her country-destroying radical left agenda once and for all. We cannot have it happen. So, you must get out and you must vote. Here in this incredible Commonwealth, we stand on the shoulders of generations of Pennsylvania patriots, who gave everything they could give, every single thing, for their rights and for their freedom. Pennsylvania is where our founding fathers declared American independence and sounded the beautiful Liberty Bell. It's where the Army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge, where General George Washington led his men on a daring mission across the Delaware. And where generations of top, strong, beautiful miners and steelworkers put Pennsylvania spirit into every single thing they did.
And from Gettysburg to Germantown, and Philadelphia to Barren Hill, and from Brandywine to right here in Butler, this is the place where Pennsylvania patriots poured out their blood with the love of their country. They love their country so much. And so, in honor of all those American heroes who came before us, we will press forward, we will push onward, and together we will win, win, win. We're going to win, win, win. Nothing will sway us, nothing will slow us, and no one will ever stop us. No matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles we must face, we will keep striving toward our magnificent American future. We will not fail; we will not allow ourselves to fail.
From this day forward, we will always put America first, and we'll take back and save the United States. November 5th, election day, will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together, with the great people of Pennsylvania, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Pennsylvania. God bless you. God bless you, Pennsylvania.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999490976333618,Populist

Indeed, a lot of young people have been wound up by scare stories and are actually very angry and very scared about their future. It's an irony really, that it's the youth of a country that appear to be worried right across the whole of the European Union. It is the under-30s that are protesting in the streets against undemocratic centralised control and indeed against the Euro and virtually everything that emanates from Brussels. In time, I hope that some of these sharp divisions can be healed when people start to realise that actually life outside the European Union is really very exciting and we've got a much better, brighter future in charge of our own lives. And certainly, the stock markets, despite everything George Osborne told us, have rallied very strongly. FTSE is now about 14 per cent higher than it was during it's February lows, addling a great delight to see the number of Commonwealth countries rushing forward in a bidding war to be the first people to sign a free trade deal with an independent United Kingdom.

What the country needs is strong leadership. What it needs is direction. What it needs is not business as usual. I'm certain of one thing, I'm certain that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. We've won that. And in terms of our Parliament, and in terms of our courts that's a great historic victory. What I'm less certain of is what deal this government are going to cut. And we need a new Prime Minister who puts down some clear red lines: that we're not going to give in on issues like free movement. And we need a Prime Minister that is not going to sell us out to what is known as the Single Market but effectively a big business protectionist cartel.
So we need a vision from our new leader, a vision that shows that we're going to be engaged with the world and turn us into an enterprise economy, and to do that and to achieve that, a team of negotiators that include figures from across the political spectrum, which reflects that Brexit vote, and crucially, we need some business people, who know not only how the world works, but understand the importance of lobbying industry directly.
We need to be lobbying the German car industry, the French wine producers, because next year, both France and Germany have general elections. It is pressure on Merkel; it is pressure on Hollande from within those countries that is likely to get us the best possible deal. And we need to go global and there is no reason to wait for this at all.
As soon as we get a new Prime Minister, we need teams and negotiators. I'm told we have got the skill; I'm told we don't have the confidence or the expertise within our own civil service, which I suppose is the price you pay when you give away the ability to run your own country. So let's help them. Let's get them in from Singapore, or South Korea, or Chile, or Switzerland, or any of these countries who've managed to achieve far more in terms of global trade deals than we have as part of the European Union. So we are now in charge of our own future and I want us to grab this opportunity with both hands.
Now one of the questions that is being asked is, what of Ukip? What is the future for Ukip after this result? Well we've clearly established ourselves as the third political force in this country, and this year we have extended our elective representation to the Welsh Assembly and to the London Assembly. And there's no doubt that without us, without the growth in Ukip, there would not have been a referendum. And there's also no doubt that when it came to the ground campaign in this referendum, it was the people's army of Ukip who were out there, delivering the leaflets, putting out the posters, and doing all that work that needed, desperately, to be done. And I do believe myself, that it's Ukip, and Ukip's messages that inspired non-voters to go out there and make the difference. Without Ukip, there is no way that the Leave vote would ever have got over the line. So Ukip needs to be strong.
We need to be strong and push to try and make sure that this country gets the best possible terms. And in electoral terms, well, the party now has built up a very loyal following of people, who want to go out and vote Ukip at every given opportunity. And they see us, our voters, they see us as being the one party that's actually prepared to stand up for ordinary, decent people. I feel that the deeper the crisis in the Labour party becomes, and there are certainly no signs of that going away, the further the Parliamentary Labour party and Labour leadership get away from their own voters. I feel, perhaps, that's where our greatest potential lies. Ukip right now is in a very sound financial position, I do believe we need some reform of its management structures, I think there is further professionalism that needs to be done. But the party is in a pretty good place, certainly, compared to all the others. And if we do not get a satisfactory Brexit deal, that allied to the woes of the Labour party and that ground swallowing level of support from Ukip loyalists, if we don't get a good Brexit deal, then in 2020, watch this space.
And the other subject of speculation has been, what am I going to do? Well, all I can say on this long journey is a huge thanks to all who are in this room today. And it has been a very long journey. Not at every stage of the way, an easy one, although most of it, I have to say, has been tremendous fun. But when I think back, to when I first stood for Ukip, or in fact when I stood for anybody, in the Eastleigh by-election which took place in 1994, and I managed to scrape past screaming Lord Sutch by a massive 164 votes, and to have gone from that to being part of a national campaign that attracted 17.5 million votes for Brexit, says to me, tough as though it has been at times, it has certainly all been worth it. I came into politics from business because I believed that this nation should be self-governing. I have never been, and I have never wanted to be, a career politician. My aim in being in politics was to get Britain out of the European Union.
That is what we voted for in that referendum two weeks ago and that is why I now feel that I've done my bit, that I couldn't possibly achieve more than we managed to get in that referendum, and so I feel it's right that I should now stand aside as leader of Ukip. I will continue to support the party, I will support the new leader. I will watch the negotiation process in Brussels like a hawk and perhaps comment in the European Parliament, from time to time. I'm also very keen to help the independence movements that are springing up in other parts of the European Union, because I'm certain of one thing: you haven't seen the last country that wants to leave the EU. It has been a huge chunk of my life, doing this, and it's not easy, perhaps, when you feel a degree of ownership of something, to let it go. But it does come, as I say, at a cost to me and to those around me. During the referendum campaign, I said I want my country back; what I'm saying today, is that I want my life back. It begins right now. Thank you!",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9995704293251038,0.0,0.0,0.0,Populist

After twenty years. What an audience. Look at you. All that work. All those leaflets. Up at dawn. I know well those streets you have trodden. But you have done magnificently. And how it's paid off.
We are changing the face of British politics.
Jane Collins second in Rotherham parliamentary by-election last year. 16 per cent up, second place, you have no idea what that did to them in Westminster! And in Downing Street it was even worse. Even better, I mean.
Richard Elvin, in the North East came second in Middlesbrough's parliamentary by-election and second in South Shields. They weigh the Labour vote in South Shields but they obviously use Imperial measures because Richard took UKIP from 0 to 25 per cent in three weeks.
Diane James, second in Eastleigh's parliamentary by-election. Over 11,000 votes - 24 per cent up. Close, so close. Next time, Diane.
That's the change.
I said then we were overtaking the Lib Dems to become the third party in British politics.
We've thirty thousand members and growing fast.
Certainly by the time of the general election we'll be the third highest-membership party in Britain.
Every other party is fighting their decline.
We're delighted, they're appalled; the commentators are amazed.
In eight months' time there are the European elections and the Council elections.
UKIP will be standing in both sets, fielding thousands of candidates.
I'm taking nothing for granted but I think we're going to do well in the European elections. My ambition, my conviction is that we can come first and cause an earthquake.
But I also believe that the Council elections may turn out to be more important.
We made a breakthrough this year and we now have 227 council seats.
I wouldn't presume to make predictions about what May will bring. But we do want more - hundreds more.
It's possible. I think we can all feel it.
On the doorstep we tell voters that UKIP councillors aren't constrained by Labour or Conservative affiliations. They are un-whipped. Free to represent the interests of the community. To fight for the right for local people to have referendums on key local issues such as fracking and the building of wind farms.
And what support we find out there. What eclectic support. Look at you!
You did it. We did it. Everyone in this hall.
When I heard MPs had voted against a strike on Syria. When I heard the Tories were voting for a referendum, I thought it again - we may not have MPs but we're changing the face of British politics.
Politicians in Parliament are listening not to their party whips but to their voters.
It's a change that's been gathering force for twenty years.
Part hope, part fear, part disillusionment, part engagement.
When we launched our party just 17 per cent of British people agreed we should withdraw from the European Union.
Today, that figure is 67 per cent.
The British Social Attitudes Survey shows how much Britain has been moving UKIP's way.
On many different areas of our national life.
On welfare - that benefits should be there for need, not as a lifestyle choice.
On education - that grammar schools are a great engine of social mobility.
And yes, on the European Union.
Yes, on immigration.
It's the biggest single issue facing this country. It affects the economy. The NHS. Schools. Public services. The deficit.
But the establishment has been closing down the immigration debate for 20 years.
UKIP has opened it up. We need to. From the 1st of January next year the stakes are rising dramatically.
Let's have that debate! Openly. We need to talk about it!
We are a nation that has always been open minded about immigration. But more people came to this country in one year, 2010 than came in the thousand years before it.
I'm not against immigration. Far from it. Migrants have qualities we all admire. Looking for a better life. They want to get on. I like that. We admire that.
So I'm speaking here as much as for the settled ethnic minorities as for those who have been here forever.
Half a million new arrivals a year!
It's just not sustainable.
Anyone who looks at it honestly knows it's not sustainable.
UKIP talks about it honestly. Directly. We've had a lot of stick for it. Normal, decent people have been bullied out of the debate.
Maybe that's why none of the London commentariat has noticed what's going on out there in Telford, and Aylesbury, and Kettering, and Buxton and Harrogate. It's a long way from London. But all over the country, I'm getting audiences of five hundred or six hundred a night to talk about this.
This debate has been filling theatres. And not with party members. On a show of hands 80 per cent are non-members.
But they're interested. They're engaged. They're concerned.
These people aren't disconnected from politics. They're disconnected from politicians.
And UKIP is the only party that isn't afraid to talk to them about it.
So who are we? Who is the typical UKIP voter? I'll tell you something about the typical UKIP voter - the typical UKIP voter doesn't exist.
When I look at the audiences in those theatres there is a range of British society from all parts of the spectrum. Workers, employers, self-employed. Big businessmen, corner shop owners. Well off, comfortably off, struggling. Young as well as old. Not ideologues. Some left, some right, mostly in the middle. Some activists, some haven't voted for twenty years.
One thing many have in common: they are fed up to the back teeth with the cardboard cut-out careerists in Westminster.
The spot-the-difference politicians.
Desperate to fight the middle ground, but can't even find it.
Focus groupies.
The triangulators.
The dog whistlers.
The politicians who daren't say what they really mean.
And that's why UKIP attracts this eclectic support.
Because when we believe something - we don't go ""are you thinking what we're thinking"". We say it out loud.
That's why UKIP is the most independent-minded body of men and women who have ever come together in the name of British politics.
Which presents occasional difficulties.
We have some people with overactive Facebook accounts. And we have some who make public pronouncements that I would not always choose myself.
Indeed I had the most blistering row with Godfrey Bloom in a Strasbourg restaurant the other day. He wants to fight for his beliefs and I was saying that we need to stick to the big messages. I don't always agree on policy with Stuart Wheeler either.
But, the essence of our recent success is our ability to push the boundaries of debate and with that, the national debate on many issues.
If the choice is between our being browbeaten through political correctness to stay within the current received wisdoms or to be a party of free debate then be in no doubt we must be the party of radical alternatives and free speech.
There is however one important qualification...
We oppose racism. We oppose extremism. We oppose sectarianism of the left or right.
We are the only party that bans the BNP from membership.
I've got a card here which says what UKIP is, and in the first line, it says as strongly and clearly as it can be said, UKIP opposes racism.
UKIP is a free-thinking, egalitarian party opposed to racism, sectarianism and extremism.
UKIP is dedicated to liberty, opportunity, equality under the law and the aspirations of the British people.
We will always act in the interests of Britain. Especially on immigration, employment, energy supply and fisheries.
We know that only by leaving the union can we regain control of our borders, our parliament, democracy and our ability to trade freely with the fastest-growing economies in the world.
And £55 million a day, incidentally, we get that back as well.
A referendum to allow the country to decide this matter will create the greatest opportunity for national renewal in our lifetime.
That's us.
Optimistic. Open to the world. The opposite of insular. Out there trading with countries that have growth rates of six, seven, ten per cent a year. Not hemmed in by the European Union - but open to the Commonwealth. Not headed by my old pal Herman Achille van Rompuy but by the Queen. Our real friends in the Commonwealth.
Because the fact is we just don't belong in the European Union.
Britain is different.
Our geography puts us apart. Our history puts us apart. Our institutions produced by that history put us apart. We think differently. We behave differently.
I'm not giving you the Love, Actually version of what makes Britain different.
The roots go back seven, eight, nine hundred years with the Common Law. Civil rights. Habeas corpus. The presumption of innocence. The right to a trial by jury. On the continent - confession is the mother of all evidence.
Four years ago, Andrew Symeou was charged with manslaughter on statements extracted by the police and later withdrawn - taken on the European Arrest Warrant, held for 10 months in the most appalling conditions, detained in Greece for four years and then walked free when the prosecutor pulled the case. The European Arrest Warrant is an abomination to those of us who care about freedom and justice.
And in some sense it was ever thus.
The idea of free speech was a reality in England when Europe was run by princes with tyrannical powers.
Throughout Europe, England was known as the land of liberty.
Here you had the possibility of dissent. Of free thinking. Independent minds and actions. That's us. UKIP belongs in the mainstream of British political life throughout the centuries.
I always believed since 1999 that Britain was a square peg in the round hole I've come to realize something bigger than that. The union is not just contrary to our interests but contrary to the interests of Europe itself.
The Commission has hijacked the institutions of Europe by adopting a flag, an anthem, a president, and through their mad euro project they have driven tens of millions into poverty.
Their climate change obsession has destroyed industry across Europe, and their refusal to listen to the people will lead to the very extreme nationalisms the project was supposed to stop.
We are the true Europeans. We want to live and work and breathe and trade in a Europe of democratic nations.
But in the last ten or fifteen years this country has seen astonishing change. There has been a phenomenal collapse in national self-confidence.
When we signed up to government from the Continent, most Britons didn't know what they were letting themselves in for.
Our laws have come from Brussels - and what laws. What directives. What a list of instructions. How this shall be done. How that shall be regulated. Process and compliance and inspection and regulation are taking over from production and leadership and enterprise.
Financial services make up 10 per cent of the economy. It's not just the City of London; it's Southampton as well. Cardiff. Birmingham. Newcastle. And it's insurance. Reinsurance. Stocks and shares. Futures. Commodities. Pension funds.
It is totally irrelevant to this industry whether we have a Labour or a Tory government because their livelihoods are now regulated by a Frenchman who is no friend of ours.
Parliament is reduced to the level of a large council. No one knows for sure exactly how much of our law comes from Brussels. Could be 70 or 80 per cent.
We have given up our concept of civil rights. Magna Carta, 800th anniversary the year after next, at the general election.
Habeas corpus. Rights of inheritance. And not just for the aristocracy, as time went by.
Our civil rights grew and kept pace with the times and expanded through the Common Law into the modern world - Europe has supplanted it with their Human Rights charter. While they can hold Andrew Symeou in Greece on trumped-up charges for four years - we can't deport a rapist and murderer because he has a right to a family life.
How did they do that to us?
They lied to us. They had to. We'd never have agreed to it if they told us the truth and asked for our agreement.
And it's created a complete charade in our national life.
All the parties now talk tough on immigration.
David Cameron said he would bring it down to the tens of thousands.
There are still half a million people a year coming in.
Do you know, I really think they haven't made the connection.
I was in an immigration debate chaired by Nick Robinson. I started to talk about Europe, the rights of entry and residence that EU citizens have. He stopped me. No, he said, this debate is about immigration it's not about Europe.
That's how deep the disconnect goes.
Ten thousand a week. Half a million a year. Five million economic migrants in ten years coming to this country.
Unprecedented. Never happened before.
The effects are obvious. In every part of our national life.
The strain these numbers are putting on public services.
Schools. The shortage of school places in primaries and secondary schools.
The NHS. The sheer weight of numbers that adds to the other problems of that
Housing. Demand pushes up prices.
Wages are driven down by the massive over-supply of unskilled labour.
And from the 1st of January next year, the risks increase massively.
The seven year period is up and nearly 30 million of the good people of Bulgaria and Romania have open access to our country, our welfare system our jobs market.
How many will take advantage of that no one knows.
The Home Office don't have any idea at all. The previous estimate was 13,000 in total. Migration Watch thinks 50,000 a year. It could be many times that.
No one knows. It's no way to run a policy.
And you can't blame people wanting to come here.
I don't blame them.
I'd come here myself if I was in their position.
So would you. Anyone would be tempted.
In Bulgaria and Romania, average earnings are a fifth of ours.
The purchasing power of £20 of child benefit a week is five times over there what it is here.
So consider a family of mum, dad and three children. They're going to think, let's send Dad over to get work in Britain. That enterprising and industrious fellow can come here, find a job, and be eligible for child benefit for his three children - even though they aren't living here.
£60 a week - with the purchasing power of five times that. Sent back to Romania or Bulgaria. What an incentive. What a draw. What a pull factor, as they call it in immigration circles.
And while you can't blame them - is it fair? Is it fair for the people who are already here in this country. Who've paid in to the system?
That migrants can come and immediately start drawing benefits?
When we, the host country, is strapped for cash, when youth unemployment is at a million, when the NHS is groaning and the deficit is a burden on every family?
I know it isn't fair. I know it isn't right. And I know there isn't a thing the Government can do about it.
There is an even darker side to the opening of the door in January. London is already experiencing a Romanian crime wave. There have been an astounding 27,500 arrests in the Metropolitan Police area in the last five years. 92 per cent of ATM crime is committed by Romanians. This gets to the heart of the immigration policy that UKIP wants, we should not welcome foreign criminal gangs and we must deport those who have committed offences. Mr. Cameron, Clegg and Milliband are you listening?
If they are listening there's not a thing they can do. They are tied up in the cat's cradle of EU laws, regulations, directives and treaties.
The only way this can be dealt with is by leaving the EU.
Not prolong the agony. But leave, and leave soon. That's what UKIP has been arguing for twenty years and what an increasing majority of the British people are - with very good reason - coming to believe as well.
Sixty seven per cent. Research suggests that 67 per cent of Britons now support leaving the Union.
I'm not sure how carefully everyone has thought this through, so let me say a little about what life outside the Union looks like to me.
I believe that leaving the Union and reclaiming our destiny will create the most exciting opportunity for national renewal in our lifetime.
At the most basic level we get back £55 million a day. It adds up. It's £20 billion a year. We could reduce the deficit. We could reduce corporation tax to 10 per cent. Give us the most competitive and attractive business taxes in the western world.
We get our money back.
We get our borders back.
We get our Parliament back.
We get our fisheries back.
We get our own seat in on the bodies that actually run the world.
We get back the ability to strike free trade deals. We can abolish tariffs on African produce and do more to raise living standards there than any amount of aid.
There are those who say we can't go it alone. That our global influence will decline because we are small.
Those are the true voices of Little England. We speak for Great Britain.
No longer bound into an ageing and increasingly arthritic trade bloc where growth of 2 and 3 per cent is an ambition.
Instead, the world. The Commonwealth. Trading with Brazil, Asia, the Commonwealth where growth rates in double figures will bring wealth back to this country.
No more relying on debt-fuelled booms to get things going. No more growth through credit card excesses. We earn our way to national prosperity by free trade with the world.
And just to counter the scare stories the status quo put up to frighten people back into line, I'll tell you what won't happen.
Those ten thousand trucks a day coming in from the continent bringing goods into this country. They won't stop coming.
The £25 to £35 billion trade surplus the rest of Europe runs with us. That's not going to stop.
The idea that the EU will start a trade war with Britain is simply not credible.
The real reason the EU won't be able or willing to stop trading with us is that the German car industry won't allow it. I just can't see Mrs Merkel explaining to Mercedes that they're not going to be selling into Britain any more.
It's not going to happen.
Leaving the Union will give us our country back and open a door to the world.
We are changing the face of British politics and all our arguments are gaining traction. In rhetoric the other parties are attempting to move in to our territory but without the slightest intention of delivering.
So Mr. Cameron wants a referendum... well we've heard it all before with his ""cast iron guarantee"" and we don't believe that he is sincere. The use of the word renegotiation is no more than a cynical tactic to kick the issue into the long grass after the next election. I have no doubt that Labour and the Lib Dems will do exactly the same thing. They all promise a referendum at every General Election and renege on their promises.
But the next election is not, as you would believe reading the newspapers, in 2015. The next election is on May 22nd 2014, the European Elections.
They offer voters a chance to really express their view without worrying which lot get in to Downing Street.
The campaign will be dominated by open door immigration to Eastern Europe. If the coalition wants to save their electoral skins they must, before January 1st, tell Brussels that we will not unconditionally open our door to Bulgaria and Romania.
That is my challenge to them. If they ignore it then we must turn the Euro Elections into the referendum that we have not been given.
Let's make May 22nd as our referendum on EU membership, let us send an earthquake through Westminster. Let us stand up and say: Give us our country back!",0.0,0.0,0.3178539574146271,0.6820199489593506,0.0,0.0,0.0,Populist
UK_POP_03,UK,Populist,Nigel Farage,25/09/2015,Conference speech,https://www.c-span.org/program/international-telecasts/uk-independence-party-conference-nigel-farage-speech/416132,3751,Conference,Y,Y,farageconference2015.txt,farageconference2015_cleaned.txt,UKIP conference speech 2015,"Well, thank you. I Well, good morning, everybody. And thank you for that warm reception. I have to say, um, I thought the day after the general election that I would not be addressing the UKIP party conference this year as leader, um, as I'd stood down and I thought that perhaps my life was going to become quieter and simpler and easier, but it was because of the over. The overwhelming response I had from you, the members, the candidates, the national executive Committee of the party, and one or two wise people saying, Nigel, if you've spent more than 20 years preparing for an in-out referendum, perhaps you'd better lead UKIP into the campaign. And so I'm here. They In a sense, the general election ended 2.5 years of nonstop remarkable campaigning. It really all began with the Eastleigh by-election, where we stunned everybody coming from nowhere to getting 29% of the vote. It led in to those English county council elections where we got 23% of the vote in all those English counties. It led on to the European elections in 2014, where we achieved 4.4 million votes, and we came first across the United Kingdom. And it led on, and it led on to the remarkable victory in the Clacton by-election from Douglas Carswell, and it led, of course, to Mark Reckless appearing on this stage last year and winning the Rochester by-election. We had an amazing run. But the general election in many ways was a whole different ball game up against parties that were bigger, stronger, and better funded than we were. And goodness knows we tried. We tried to broaden out the arguments. I tried in those debates, those TV leaders' debates, to point out that far from this government. Having been prudent with our money, actually George Osborne in the space of 5 years had doubled the national debt. He'd increased our debt by more than the Labour Party had managed in 13 years. I mean that takes some doing, doesn't it? We tried to point out that selection and education would close the ever widening class gap in this country. We tried to make the arguments that Britain's armed forces are seriously under-resourced. We tried to do those things, but in many ways it was difficult to get those arguments through. There are times in elections, there are times in life where whatever you do, you cannot change the cards that are dealt, and actually what decided this election was a big swing to the Conservatives for fear of that woman north of the border. And And that Ed Miliband wasn't really up to being Prime Minister, so there was nothing we could really do about that. But the one argument that I did make, and we all made in the general election, and in some ways we got criticized for. Now the one argument we did make was that open door immigration as a result of our membership of the European Union is a wholly, thoroughly irresponsible thing to do. And how on earth can any government at local or national level plan for school provision? Plan for health provision. If you don't know in a couple of years' time with the nearest couple of million, how many people will actually be living in the country, and we made those arguments. And we made the argument. We made the argument that immigration can be a good thing for Britain, but that what we want is not an open door to cheap, unskilled labor. What we want is an Australian style points system. So that we can decide the quality and quantity of who comes to Britain. Well, I was told, I was told that I'd put too much emphasis on this, that we should talk about other things that people are really concerned about. Well, I did try 9 days before the general election in a speech in the European Parliament in Strasbourg to point out that Mr. Juncker's implementation. Of the EU common asylum policy would lead to an exodus of biblical proportions. No one noticed what I said at the time, but I think the events have proved me to be right. And now And now over the course over the course of a summer, 15% rise in the number of people who think immigration and open borders are the number one issue in British politics. 50% of people now put that at number one, with the economy trailing behind at 27%. I would argue to you that we were right to campaign on that issue, that we do actually own that issue, that the British public believe us on that issue. Now look, whichever way you look at this. If you'd said to me a year ago there'd be a big swing to the Conservatives for fear of the SNP, if you said to me there'd be a Conservative majority government, I wouldn't have believed you, but if you'd said despite all of that, UKIP would still get 4 million votes in a British general election, frankly, I would have bitten your arm off, and I think we can hold our heads held high and be proud of what we achieved. I really do. The fact that it only led to one seat in Westminster says that the system is crying out, and we need electoral reform in Britain, though I suspect at the moment we should not hold our breath. But one really good thing. One really amazingly brilliant thing did come out of the general election, and that is that we are going to have an in-out referendum on our membership of the European Union, and that would never have happened without the collective efforts of everybody in UKIP. Now Now there's been some considerable fallout from the general election, quite an aftermath, particularly in the case of the Labour Party. Now the great myth that the commentariat have talked about for years is that UKIP would hurt the Conservative vote and therefore lead to a Labor government. And what we saw, and particularly in the Midlands and the North, what we saw was UKIP tearing great big chunks out of that Labor vote. We hurt the Labour Party far more than we hurt the Conservative Party. And they They very quickly entered into a quite remarkable leadership election. which has resulted in Jeremy Corbyn. Becoming the leader of the Labour Party. Now it was put about the day that he was elected. By Diane Abbott, I think. Well, she should know. I know, anyway. The thing It was put about by Diane Abbott that Jeremy being in charge of a Labour Party would mean that all of those voters who deserted Labour and gone to UKIP would come back. Well, let's have a little examination of that, shall we? Do you honestly think that Labor voters that came to UKIP in Doncaster agree with Mr. Corbyn that we should get rid of the Queen? Do you honestly think that Labour voters in Doncaster who came to UKIP would approve of a man who cozied up to the likes of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness? Do you honestly think that Labour voters in Doncaster would think that it was a good idea for us to hand the Falkland Islands over to Argentina? Do you honestly think that people in Doncaster who switched to UKIP think that it's right and appropriate that at a service in St. Paul's Cathedral to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, a room in which there were perhaps for the last ever time gathered together significant numbers of men and women in their 90s who were part of that great battle that it was right to turn up without your top button done up and not to sing the national anthem. I think on all of those reasons, on all of those reasons, Corbyn is 1000 miles away from those Labour voters that have come to UKIP, but there was perhaps just one area on which he could have held on to a lot more Labour votes and maybe even tempted one or two back despite everything else, and it was that for 40 years we'd understood that Jeremy Corbyn, this man remember of great principle, That Jeremy Corbyn, having been a, you know, an avowed admirer of Tony Benn and Michael Foote, that Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to Britain being a member of the European Union because he believed that it damaged us as a nation state democracy. And so There was, there was room to believe that Corbyn would stick to his beliefs, and yet within a week of being in charge of a Labor Party that has now become completely obsessively Europhile in every way and under pressure from his shadow cabinet and under pressure from his backbenches, he has capitulated on that great issue of principle, and he has said. He will support Britain remaining in the European Union regardless of what Mr. Cameron comes back with, and I now think, I now think and believe that a whole new flank of the Labour vote in the Midlands and the North and Wales and right across this country, I believe that a whole new flank of the Labour vote is there for UKIP. I think Corbyn is a gift to UKIP. And what of us? And what of UKIP? Well, after every election, commentators are pleased to say that UKIP's gone and the bubble has burst and everything else. But how's UKIP 5 months on? Well, let me tell you, 5 months on, UKIP is not only alive and well, not only alive and kicking, but is up in the opinion polls from where it was in the general election back in May. But That we as a party are now massively increasing our reach and our support on social media. We're getting many more young people supporting us. UKIP is getting ready and preparing, and next year. In May of next year we will fight elections. We'll fight the police and crime commissioner elections. We'll fight the local elections that take place in England, but we'll also fight the elections in Scotland, in Northern Ireland. We'll fight the elections in Wales and we'll fight the elections in London. And in all four of those big elections, there is a fundamental difference between them and the general election, and it's called proportional representation. I And I think I think UKIP will significantly increase its elected representation in this country in those elections, and we will maintain our position as the only UK party with elected representation in all four corners of the United Kingdom. So electorally, that's our big challenge for May of next year, but I have to say to you, as the leader of this party, as somebody who's given over 20 years of his life to helping build this party, whilst of course I want us to do well as a party and to succeed in those elections, there is something that is actually dearer to my heart than party politics, even if it's UKIP. I want us. To summon every resource of energy that we can find in our bodies and our minds, I want us to dedicate ourselves wholly to winning that referendum and breaking the link with political union with Europe. And that And that's a message we must send out to other activists and councilors and MPs and MEPs in the other political parties. This is the moment to put country before party. This is a once, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get back the independence and self-government of this nation. Our message is clear. We want our country back. Now So there are really, there are really 3 sides to this referendum campaign, and I'll go through them one by one. There's the in campaign, and we know who they are. It's Sir Richard Branson. It's Oh, I've got better than that coming. Don't you worry. It's Tony Blair. And top of the bill it's Peter Mandelson. So we've got, we've got the side that will campaign for us to remain. We've got the side who will campaign for us to leave, and I'll talk more about that in the course of this speech, and then we've got the Prime Minister. Or should I call him in this context, piggy in the middle? Well, I enjoyed it anyway. Now there are some, there are some in the wake of the general election. There are some, as I would call them, soft Eurosceptics. who have suggested that our best policy is to stand still, to let Dave do the renegotiation, to see what he comes back with, and then to make our minds up. There are even some in the soft Eurosceptics who think we should be pushing for a two referendum strategy. That we should vote to leave in order to renegotiate a better deal, and my message to those people is you are fundamentally wrong. Firstly, this needs to be straightforward and simple, and for the first time ever on a UKIP platform, I'm going to thank the Electoral Commission for once for doing their job and for making sure that Cameron's attempt to stitch up the referendum question has been unraveled. Thank you, electoral commission. But to wait would be a terrible, terrible mistake. It would be to play into the hands of the Prime Minister so that he could set the terms, as he's done, of the renegotiation, and unchallenged, he would set his own bar and he would come back to Brussels crying a great victory in the renegotiations. And by the time the leave side had mobilized effectively the referendum would be over because make no mistake, Those that want us to stay in the European Union, and I'm talking about most of our political class, I'm talking about many of the giant corporate business interests. They're out there campaigning every day, you know, we see Branson on the Marr Show. Ken Clarke, I think, has appeared more on television in the last 5 months than the previous 40 years. I mean, I mean they're out there, they're out there and they're campaigning hard, and we know they'll campaign hard and we'll know, we know they'll be well funded, but we have to explain to people that if you vote to stay in the European Union, you're not voting to stay in the union as it now is. Just listen to what Blair, Mandelson, Branson, and the others say when they're asked, Do you think we should join the euro? They say yes when the time is right. Ask them, do you think we should be part of a European army? And they say, Well, we think increased military cooperation in Europe would be good. Ask them, Should we take Mr. Juncker or should I say Chancellor Merkel's quotas? And they say yes, we should be fully signed up to an EU common asylum and ultimately from next year an EU common immigration policy. If you vote, if we as a country vote to remain in this union, we are not voting for the status quo. We are not voting for where we are now. We are voting to remain part of an integrationist project, and that I think we have to point out, and we have to unpick. The Prime Minister's so-called renegotiation. He isn't asking for anything substantial at all, nothing. Nothing. He isn't asking. He isn't asking for us to get back control over open borders and the free movement of people to nearly half a billion. He isn't asking for us to get back the supremacy of British law in our own parliament and indeed that our own Supreme Court should be supreme. He isn't even asking that our membership fee of £55 million a day should be reduced. And he certainly isn't asking for anything that the British public in a full debate would want to have. Indeed, if this referendum was about whether Britain was to join the European Union. We would look at the crisis in the Mediterranean that has been so appallingly mishandled. We would look at the way through failed policy. We have encouraged families and young men to go into the hands of the criminal traffickers, leading to so much misery. We would look at the Eurozone. Where now if the Greeks have a general election and decide a course of policy, they can be overridden, we'd look at the whole thing and we'd say no, we're not going to join. And so what we have to do is we have to explain to people that the risk of voting to remain in this union is far greater. Than the risk of voting to take back control of our laws and our borders and our own lives. Let's make the positive argument. Let's make the positive argument. Let's make the positive argument for trade with Europe, for cooperation with Europe, for being good next door neighbors with Europe. Let's make that argument. But let us, as has been said already this morning, let's talk about the world. Let's talk about Britain's place in the world. Let's talk about who we are as a people, you know, surely, surely we should be able and capable to negotiate our own trade deals on the world stage. And yet, and yet when I had that debate, those two debates in fact with Nick Clegg last year, and thank you, Nick, for giving me that fantastic opportunity. But when I had those debates. There was a point at which Clegg said we need to be in the European Union because only by being an EU member do we have clout on the international stage to make trade deals, and I turned to Nick and I said, Iceland with a population of 317,000. has just concluded its own trade deal with China. If Iceland is big enough and strong enough to make its own trade deals, I'm damn sure that we are big enough and strong enough to make our own trade deals. And then And then it came to me, then it came to me. I understood what Nick Clegg was really saying. I understand what Branson and Blair and Mandelson. I understand what they're all really saying. What they're saying isn't that we're not big enough. What they're saying is we're not good enough. They don't think we're good enough to make our own laws, control our own borders, make our own trade deals, run our own businesses, set our own energy standards, control our own fishing waters, and set the standards for British farming. And to win this. referendum, we've got to put out a big positive message. We are patriotic and proud of who we are as a people, as a country. We are proud of those that went before us and sacrificed much so that we could be that free, independent country, and we certainly And we certainly We certainly believe that Britain is good enough, that we are good enough to stand on our own 2 ft and trade with the world. We'll win this with that big, strong, positive message. We really will. We really will. But one of the problems with the Eurosceptic movement in this country is it has been for all the 25 years that I've been involved with it, it has very often been fractured. It has very often been divided. It has very often been a valid. Pertinent and correct criticism to say that the Eurosceptic groups are all run by egomaniacs, that they, with some exceptions one hopes. That the groups are all run by egomaniacs, that they can never work with each other, that they all hate each other, that they're more concerned with who is top dog on our side of the argument than fighting the enemy, and that, I think, is what is the most significant thing about today's UKIP conference. Yes, we're here as a party getting ready to fight those May elections next year, getting ready to have more electoral success, getting ready to build our base. Of elected representatives, but the single most important and significant thing about this conference is that what I have to say to you is I am just massively impressed with what Aaron Banks and the men and women around him have done in putting together the non-political party umbrella group of Leave.eu. I'm impressed. I'm impressed. I'm impressed that they're prepared to put their hands in their pockets and that money isn't an issue. I'm impressed that they set up social media platforms that are booming and they're gaining about 7000 new supporters every single day. But most of all, I'm impressed that the people running it have absolutely no personal political ambition of their own at all. They're doing it because they believe it's the right thing to do. And I think And I think that what Leave.EU have done is remarkable because they have managed to get every single one of those groups who is committed to leaving the European Union for the first time ever together under their umbrella, and that is an absolutely fantastic achievement, and we should congratulate them for doing it. There's been, there's been speculation about which group would get the official designation for the Leave the EU campaign. But as I see it at the moment, there is only one group that set up an umbrella that is absolutely clear in what it stands for, and that is the Leave.EU campaign, and I say to you today that UKIP will now stand hand in hand with Leave.EU. We will work together as a united force of all the Eurosceptic groups that want to lead the European Union. We are, we are together, we are united, and I believe, I believe that the tide. Has turned. I think something is changing out there, and I believe we're on course to win the most historic and the most important political victory in any of our lifetimes. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. All right, thanks. Good, good. OK, good. Well, I think we, we, you know, we know where we're going, don't we? Brilliant, thank you. All right. All right. All right.

UK_POP_04,UK,Populist,Nigel Farage,21/05/2019,Rally speech,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/nigel-farage-we-re-attempting-a-peaceful-political-revolution/,1969,Rally,Y,Y,faragebrexitrally2019.txt,faragebrexitrally2019_cleaned.txt,Brexit party rally 2019,"Do you know we only launched this party five and a half weeks ago. In that space of time we've managed to assemble this fantastic team of candidates. We've managed to go to the top of the opinion polls in five and a half weeks - that's not bad, is it? We've managed, in five and a half weeks, not just to frighten the establishment. Oh no, they're not freighted - they're absolutely terrified.

Perhaps most important of all... What we managed to do in those five and a half weeks since we launched in that factory in Coventry, is we've managed to give millions and millions of people in this country, who were frustrated, upset, angry, on the point of saying that they'd never engage the democratic process again, so sick to death were they at the shenanigans in Westminster... we've given them hope, optimism, and belief in their country.
It's worth reminding ourselves of why we're here. I can scarcely believe that I'm here. Twenty years I've been in that European Parliament, twenty years. Of getting up - one or two of you may have seen the speeches, I don't know - giving my always helpful, constructive speeches. Oh, I think Van Rompuy rather enjoyed it really.
Twenty years of taking on him and Mr Juncker, and Donald Tusk, Michel Barnier, one more, better than that: Verhofstadt. Twenty years of doing my bit, but twenty years of trying to do myself out of a job. Twenty years of being the turkey who always wanted to vote for Christmas. So I never imagined I would be standing in elections and come to think of it, if you think I've given them a tough time over there, what do you think Anne Widdecombe's going to do when she's there?
But look, the reason we're here is very simple. The reason we're doing this is because after that astonishing referendum, when Project Fear was in full mode, wasn't it? We had that Chancellor George Osborne, telling us that half a million jobs would go immediately, there would be an emergency budget, taxes would go up, house prices would crash, foreign and direct investment would cease, trade would collapse... plagues of black locusts. We had all that, and then they even shipped in - and they thought this would be their big card, I won't say Trump card but he did come from America. And he's called President Obama, remember that. And their leader said we would go to the back of the queue if we voted for Brexit.
We had of course - we were lucky though - lucky in the referendum that we have a state broadcaster in this country. Well I'm sure you're all delighted paying your £150 a year for the BBC, aren't you? I mean personally, I'm particularly a fan of the Andrew Marr show. Despite media bias, despite Project Fear, despite it all, we voted for Brexit, and we did so by a large and clear majority of 1.3 million.
Remember David Cameron - do you remember David Cameron? David Cameron told us in that leaflet that went through every door in the land, that our will would be implemented. And then we had a general election in which the Conservative and Labour parties promised us that if we voted for them they would honour the result of the referendum. And 498 members of parliament voted for article 50 and it went into British law, and it said we would leave the European Union on March the... [audience: 29th], on March the... [audience: 29th]. Thank you: we would leave the EU on March 29th with or without a deal. And that became part of British law.
And I have to tell you that I made, without doubt, the biggest political mistake of my life, because I believed it was going to happen. I believed they were going to deliver. I'm sure most of you believed they would deliver, because after all we are supposed to be a democratic country.
And yet, as the months went by, from Mrs May coming back with her Chequers deal, all the way through to her constant rejections by the House of Commons. Oh, and by the way, have you seen what she's done this afternoon? Just when you think she can't sink any lower, she comes back and surprises us. I mean now she has surrendered to virtually everything. Surrendered to the Customs Unions, surrendered to single market rules. And if you vote for her deal there is a chance to vote on a second referendum.
If there are any conservatives out there, or any eurosceptics, who believe in the democratic process, who are thinking of voting for May's Conservatives on Thursday in the European elections - you've just been told: 'you are not wanted'. Well, I know where they can go.
I've watched this slow-motion betrayal, and I realised as March 29th approached that we simply weren't going to leave. And I thought to myself, it was unbelievable really, that I have spent 25 years of my life campaigning. I must be the patron saint of lost causes. But I kept on going. And having seen what Parliament was going to do, and make no mistake, both parties here are as guilty as each other, make no doubt about that. Would I allow myself to simply be rolled over by the political process? Or would I stand up and fight? And I decided to stand up and fight. And that is why I founded the Brexit party.
But clearly, not everybody is pleased. I said to you earlier that the establishment is terrified and they cannot believe that we've managed to, in the space of five and half weeks, get over 100,000 people to spend £25 online and support the Brexit Party.
They've decided to go on an all-out attack. Yesterday we saw Gordon Brown attack the potential financial probity of the Brexit Party. Yeah, that's right, Gordon Brown attacked our financial probity. This is the man... who told the world the date on which he would do it, and sold 400 metric tonnes of gold at 270 dollars an ounce. Thank you, Gordon Brown for that.
Gordon Brown, along with Tony Blair... I'll try my best not to get sued for libel here, when, shall we say, an astonishing number of Labour donors went to the House of Lords, and he has the effrontery to attack us for our funding.
Guess what happens. The Electoral Commission announce that they can announce a dawn raid on the offices of the Brexit Party. Let me tell you this for a fact, alright. We have a team of professionally trained accountants looking after the money. We're not stupid... Last week we met the Electoral Commission and they said our processes were correct, they have no concerns. Indeed, we said to them: would you come into our offices and have a look at our systems? They said no, we haven't got time before the election. We asked them to put it in writing, that our processes were good, but they didn't decide to take us up on it... Now it was decided that I might not be the best person to greet them. That was a good call. So Richard [Tice] got the job. Can I tell you - after seven hours today in the office, the Electoral Commission have not found a single trace of wrongdoing.
Let's make it clear to the conspiracy theorists, to those who think somehow the Russians are funding us, let's make it clear to the media where our money comes from. Would you please put up your hand if you paid your £25? That is where our money is coming from, it's coming from a mass movement of people who are excited, energetic and optimistic and realise we will get Brexit, but we just have to stand up and fight for it again.
I won't even dignify the behaviour of that yobo yesterday by talking about it, but why vote for the Brexit Party on Thursday? This is now about far more than leaving the European Union. This is now about a bigger, more fundamental question of democracy. Do you trust our political class? And how do you think the rest of the world now sees us? Mrs May, by her constant abject surrenders to these unelected bully boys in Brussels, has humiliated our nation and I've had enough of it. Let's stand up and be proud.
If the Brexit Party can win well on Thursday, we put back on the table, with that new deadline of 31 October, Halloween, trick or treaty. If we win the election well, we put back on the table... our exit on WTO terms.
If we win big on Thursday, we will kill off any prospect of Parliament forcing a second referendum upon us, because they will lose. If we win on Thursday - given that democratic mandate, that people on this team, people who've got competence, people who have been in business, people who do deals for a living, unlike the career politicians on our front benches - we demand that we are part of the negotiating team, to make sure that we do leave the European Union on 31 October.
If we win well, if we win big on Thursday, there are a couple of really nice, little bonuses that will be attached. The first is, we will quickly get rid of the worst, most duplicitous and, I still disagree with Anne Widdecombe, she's not the worst Prime Minister since Anthony Eden, she's the worst Prime Minister in the history of our nation. A big Brexit win may get rid of Jeremy Corbyn as well.
I will never make the same mistake again. I keep being asked what will happen when the Conservative party has a new leader, what will happen when somebody like Boris becomes leader. He said that Mrs May's new treaty would lead us to vassalage, it would lead us to being a slave state... I thought 'Steady on. He's using language even stronger than I am. What's going on here?' And then what happened? What happened on the third time Mrs May brought it back to the House of Commons? Despite all he'd said, and all he'd done, he voted for it. You cannot trust the political class in this country.
Happily, the two party system doesn't work anymore. Politics is broken. Somebody, us, the Brexit Party, has to challenge and break the two party system. We need major reform. We've got to get rid of the House of Lords. Mr Blair's and Mr Cameron's cronies. Oh, and the Electoral Commission. Filled up with political placemen and women - all of whom are Remainers, all of whom are part of that Westminster establishment. I think they should all be... more representative of this country.
We're the only party fighting this European election with a clear, distinctive message. We must leave on the 31 October this year. We must leave, with or without any form of trade agreement. Because we demand nothing less than a self-governing, independent, proud nation, who governs herself, chooses her own alliances and friendships around the world. And look at the advantages we have. 2.4 billion people living in the Commonwealth, let's reach out to them.
All I'm asking is for you to come out and protest on Thursday. If you think I'm asking you to stick two fingers up to the establishment on Thursday, and there's good reason of course to stick up two fingers to the establishment. But actually, I'm not asking you to do that. I'm asking you to vote for us on Thursday as the first step to fundamentally changing politics for good in this country.

It has been a day of some considerable news. It seems that female politicians are all the rage at the moment. We had our own very positive announcement overnight, of which you will hear more. But the reason that I've moved this speaking time forward is because this government is deep in crisis. Not only have they fallen into deep unpopularity within just a year of winning the general election, but it's become clear to all of us that it is a cabinet of wholly unqualified people to run our country: they are not fit to govern. I suppose we are lucky in one way, that at least the Chancellor was a senior economist at the Bank of England for 10 years and that the Business Secretary is a fully qualified solicitor, and that the Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, until half an hour ago, is an accomplished property developer and speculator, but you simply can't get away can you from being the Housing Secretary and avoiding £40,000 of council tax, and it screams to entitlement. It screams to a government that despite all the promises that this would be a new, different kind of politics is as bad, if not, worse than the one that went before. We're being told that right now, the Prime Minister is organising a reshuffle. Yet another reset, and that the names of the new Cabinet will come out later on this afternoon. Well, I did not want the Prime Minister to do anything to spoil our conference, and that is why I have come on the stage now to say they are not fit to govern. The Conservative Party are riven. In fact, Nadine Dorries said overnight, the Conservative Party are dead, deservedly so, and they will not be forgiven. They will not be forgiven for their betrayals over the course of the last five years, mass migrations, illegal immigrants crossing the Channel, sky high taxes and much else. But in the middle of this meltdown of these two parties that have dominated for 100 years, British politics, in the middle of all of this, there is a new, strong, unified party that speaks with one voice that knows it's determined to put the interests of Britain and the British people above that of outdated international treaties or dubious courts. We are the patriotic party. We are the party that stands up for decent working people, and we are the party on the rise. Just think, I stood before you this time last year, at this very conference, we only had a handful of branches around the country. We now have 450 branches that we have set in place. As we entered the general election of 2024 we had 30,000 paid up members. In the last hour, we've gone through 240,000 members. This time last year, we had very few councillors. Now we have over 900 and I've got to tell you last year, I said to all of you, May 1st is coming, volunteer to stand in the county elections. And even though the government cancelled the elections in nine of the counties that we would have won, we still won outright 10 county councils and became the largest party in three others. Unbelievable. And I'll be honest with you, as I toured around the country on May 2nd, I frankly myself, couldn't believe just how well we'd done. Couldn't believe the extent to which we caught the mood and the real icing on the cake, and it may only have been by six votes, but never let anyone tell you ever again that my vote doesn't count because it does. And we got Sarah potion elected in the Runcorn by election. We have topped over 100 of the last opinion polls. Our lead is between 10% and 15% against any of the other parties, and I tell you what, given the state of chaos they're in, I think we can increase that lead further yet, folks, it's happening. Now the next step, the next step is going to be even bigger, Scottish Parliament elections, Welsh Senedd elections, and indeed, a by election that will take place in Wales next month. All 32 London boroughs will be up for election, and we will take that seriously as we get ready to have a mayoral candidate so that we can beat Sadiq Khan next time round. We are going to need up to 5000 vetted candidates to fight those elections next year, those elections next year are an essential building block as we head towards a general election. Now, talking of the general election, it's supposed to be in I know you want it now, but it's not going to come now. The next general election is not due until 2029 but let me tell you, it's all right. I'll cheer you up in a moment. Angela Rayner going not just as Housing Secretary, but also as elected deputy leader of the Labour Party and Deputy Prime Minister, means there will be an internal election in the Labour Party. Already they are facing the threat of Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, that is, if the two could ever agree on anything, including the choice of a party name. But I put this to you, this battle for deputy leader of the Labour Party will be very like the battles they had back in the early 1980s the left of the Labour Party will rear its voice. We're used to hearing stories of splits in the Conservative Party. We're about to witness a big rift in the Labour Party too. And I think, I think if there is one really big message from me to this conference, I don't think, and the bond markets back me up, and the leftward drift backs me up, and before long, there'll be Labour MPs that reckon they've got a better chance on the Jeremy Corbyn sectarian ticket. Because frankly, folks, that's what's going on in our country, we have sectarian politics emerging. I loathe it. I loathe it. But there'll come a point when many MPs, Labour MPs, think they've got a better chance of being reelected under that ticket under Corbyn than they do under Sir Keir. I think there is every chance now of a general election happening in 2027 and we must be ready for that moment. Now we also as a party have to raise a lot of money, and we're making progress. Our treasurer, Charlton Edwards and his team are doing a great job. Our honorary treasurer, Nick Candy has personally already put in over half a million pounds of his own money. Nick we thank you for that, but I want you too in the branches to go out and work and raise money, to volunteer to be candidates, to deliver leaflets, to knock on doors. We need to be the party of activism, and I think all of us believe, don't we in what we're doing. So we must all play our part and do our bit. But one of the counter arguments, well, there are two. One is, is it a one man band? I went to the football shirt stand earlier, and there you've got 11 names, Jenkins, Tice, Pochin and so on. 11 of our most senior elected representatives and I stood in the middle and held up the shirt that said Farage, and the BBC asked me: am I a one man band? I said, look at this lot behind me. And one of the joys of this year has been seeing so many other senior Reform figures appearing on television, appearing on radio, writing articles for newspapers. We broaden the scope and fresh new people are coming in, people like Colin Sutton, the legendary detective heading up our Police and Crime Commission. People like Vanessa Frake, the toughest prison governor in the country, and many more talented people will come. And I do not believe that all governments have to be MPs in the House of Commons. That's the convention. But it doesn't work, does it? You appoint people to be a rail minister, an education secretary, who have no knowledge of the department they're supposed to run, and we will bring in a ministry of all the talents from all walks of life, and to hell with convention. But that brings me on to the other argument, where I will admit we have some weakness, and that is that none of our senior figures have ever been in government before, oh, we're beginning to see, already through the county councils, that we run certain obstructions from the civil service being put in our way. And I imagine if we win the next election, we may face similar barriers to the kinds of real change that this country needs. So we need experienced people. We need people who have been in government. We need people who understand just how the system works and what the difficulties are. We need people with experience. And that is why, after a lengthy debate and consultation. That is why I'm pleased to welcome today to the stage a woman who was served in cabinet as Culture Secretary, a woman who was sold three and a half million books, a woman who has been on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, somebody from the real world who's worked their way up, been incredibly successful, who actually crosses the boundaries from politician into celebrity, and I'm delighted that we're going to have the experience, the talent, the hard work and the loyalty of the Nadine Dorries, and I'm proud to welcome her onto the stage now. Again and again at elections, they talk the talk. They never walk the walk, but we mean what we say, and we will deliver that promise I make you. Now, Nadine is right, our country is in a very bad place. It's a mixture between anger and despair. Is it any wonder that the protests have sprung up outside the hotels. We are in economic decline. We are in societal breakdown with law and order. We are in cultural decline. It's as if our leaders have forgotten who we were, and we want to question it now, they will do everything they can to crush free speech online. We are not going to have this. Our country is, without doubt, in the most dangerous place it's been in my lifetime. And I get this in the street from people, people point at me and say, you are the last chance we've got to get this country back on track. We are the last chance the country has got to get this country back on track. And that is why, let's make Britain great again - I've heard that phrase somewhere else before - but I agree with it. And that is why, talking of flags, that is why, spontaneously, across the country, there is barely a lamp post now that does not have the Cross of St George or the Union Jack, and we love it. What is going on out there is the British people are sticking two fingers up with every flag they place to an establishment that doesn't believe in Britain, to an establishment that thinks more of the interests of other countries and foreign courts that it thinks about its own people, and those flags say we have had enough. We will make Britain safer again, beginning with zero tolerance policing. If you shoplift, you will be prosecuted. We will bring back genuine stop and search on our streets to drive out knives. We will deport foreign criminals. I am off to have lunch in a few weeks with the Prime Minister of Albania. I might book a very big plane and take a load with me. I am not sure yet. We will stop what is a threat to our national security, what is a danger to girls and women on our streets. We will stop the boats and we will detain and deport those who illegally break into our country doing what nearly every normal country around the rest of the world does. You cannot come here illegally and stay we will stop the boat within two weeks of winning government. And we will stop dangerous organisations with links to terrorism operating in our country, quite why we have been so gutless about this, both Conservative and Labour, I do not know. All across the Middle East countries have banned and proscribed the Muslim Brotherhood as a dangerous organization. We will do the very same. And we will make Britain more prosperous again. Our energy policy, led by red Ed, is a complete and utter disaster. It's all well and good for Kemi Badenoch to say drill, baby drill. Who was it that put 75% super taxes on North Sea exploration? Who was it that committed Net Zero to law in this country? They should not be believed, they should not be listened to. We will scrap ridiculous, harmful, wasteful, Net Zero policies. We will start producing our own oil and gas. We will end, we will end the full subsidies for renewable energy, which has been going on your bills for years, yet no one told you. We will end Britain being the most expensive country in the world for industrial energy. We will bring cheap energy, and we will do our utmost to re industrialise Britain, to start making things here that we want and we need. We will save huge sums of wasted public money, as our DOGE unit has already begun to do in the county councils. We will do that, and we will over the course of the next months, outline some serious cuts to the welfare budget in this country. It is not fair. It is not fair on people that get up with their alarm every morning, go to work and pay their taxes for those that choose a different lifestyle to earn more money than they do. It is morally wrong. It is outrageous, and will be the party that backs working people. And will make London a center for digital assets and crypto currencies, bringing 1000s of jobs and taking us firmly as well as re industrialising into the 21st century technologies. But you cannot do that without lots of cheap energy. We are literally betraying anyone in Britain that wants to be part of the modern digital age. And we'll end this disastrous exodus, the rich are leaving. Some people think that is fine, but if the rich leave, if the biggest taxpayers leave, it means everybody else has to pay more. It doesn't make any sense. The politics of envy has never, ever worked. I don't want big taxpayers to leave, but equally, I don't want the young and the ambitious to leave, and they're leaving in droves. So we will make sure that people come back and see us as a place to be, and let's start teaching kids at school trades and services. You know, the one thing, the one thing that AI will not replace is the local plumber. They're going to make a fortune in the years to come. In fact, looking at the bills, I suspect some of them are already but most of all, we need to make Britain proud again. We've lost our sense of who we are. We refuse to acknowledge publicly the Judeo-Christian culture and heritage that we have, and that and that underpins everything that we are. We refuse to have our kids minds poisoned in schools and universities with a twisted interpretation of the history of these amazing islands. We will not stand for it. We will police the streets and not the tweets, and change all of that legislation that is damaging our rights so very, very much. And we will respect our armed forces, and in particular, our veterans, those who served in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, being hounded for things that happened 50 years ago that will end Now I've laid out, I've laid out just some of our and I don't apologise at all for the breadth of our ambition, because that's what this country needs. It needs hope. It needs belief. It needs to smile again. It needs to believe in who we are and that we can have a great future if we turn these things around. And I'm going, in order to get all these policies brought together under one roof, and it's a massive workload, I'm going to ask Zia Yusuf, from this day to be our Head of Policy, to bring all of this together. And I will in the next few weeks, open up a new department within the party, leaning on the experience that Nadine and others have, and others will come. Others with experience will come. Don't worry about that, and we will open a Department for Preparing for Government so that when we win, we can hit the ground running. I promised you a year ago, I would professionalise the party. Have a look around you. Have a look at this conference, having our team done just the most amazing job. I promised you I would democratise the party. I think the fact that 70,000 of you voted for our new board members was an incredible show that you believe in the party you wanted this democratisation. And all I can do is to promise you that I will give this everything. I will give this absolutely everything that I've got. No one cares more about the state of this country than I do. I am determined to do something about it. I came out last year, out of retirement to try and lead a movement that would get our country back. I think we're on track. I think we're on our way. I'm proud to lead this party, and I'm proud of you for the amazing contribution you've made to our success over the next year. But I tell you what, folks, that was just the beginning. Thank you very much indeed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9799323081970215,0.0,0.0,0.019920865073800087,Populist

What a fantastic venue this is for a conference. Magnificent. I rather like sporting venues. And actually, I did have some tickets to go to the Ryder Cup today. You might have seen a little promotional film I made for the event. But I thought being at the UKIP conference was very much more important than that. A year ago, a year ago, we had our conference in London with about half the number of delegates that we've got today.

And I said to the UKIP conference last year that we would win the European elections of May 22nd 2014 and that we would create an earthquake in British politics and we did it. Now we were very ably backed and supported by our candidates, by our members, but in particular we were very, very ably backed and generously supported by a Yorkshireman.

Paul Sykes, who helped us create those poster designs, and we thank him for the contribution that he made. And I know that Paul is in the room somewhere here today. Oh, there he is. Hello, Paul. And it's great to see that Paul is still very much here with us and ready for the next battle in May of next year. Thank you. Thank you.

There was only one problem with the campaign and one problem with the poster launch. It's that we hit the front rather earlier than I would have liked. And I remember picking up the Sunday Times and it was three and a half weeks to go before the election. And there it was, UKIP take the lead. And I stared at it and I kept on staring at it. And I realised for the first time ever there was only one thing in life that's more frightening than being behind and that is being in front.

Because the establishment threw at us absolutely everything they got. Even people who we would have thought were friends of ours, the Eurosceptic newspapers, couldn't do enough to say, please, please don't vote UKIP. Please maintain the established political order in this country. You know the established political order that I mean, don't you?

The Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties. Parties that look the same, parties that sound the same, parties between whom, frankly, on major issues of substance there is now very little difference. And parties that have all been committed to signing Britain up to the European project. Parties that have been wholly uncritical of open door immigration. Parties that have contributed directly

to a downward shift in living standards in this country over the course of the last decade and more. And I'm pleased to say that UKIP voters ignored the establishment and ignored their friends in the media. And they voted for one thing above all. They voted on May the 22nd because they want change.

And we won those elections. We won those elections. But everybody in Westminster and the commentariat comforted themselves by saying, ""Don't worry, it's just a protest vote."" ""Don't worry, UKIP's poll ratings will melt away like springtime snow."" And of course they said, ""UKIP will never win a single seat in Westminster.""

and they convinced themselves that our polls would slide back to four or five or six percent and yet over the course of a summer those poll ratings have held firm over the course of a summer and the early autumn we've been winning district and county council by elections and over the course of a summer i think it's become clear that that vote for ukip it's not a protest vote

They're not voting for us just because they don't like the establishment as it is.

They're voting for us because the establishment has failed them, failed their families and failed their lives. And they're voting for us and they're sticking for us, with us, because they believe that we are the party that most represents them in their lives, with their families and with their thoughts, hopes and aspirations for the future. And I think we're now in touch with a large segment of this country. And as the summer drew to a close, just after the bank holiday Monday,

something quite remarkable happened. Douglas Carswell came to a press conference with me in Westminster, something that had not been leaked or briefed in any way at all, and we were able to produce Douglas at that press conference rather like a political jack-in-the-box. And up appeared Carswell, not just to say that he was going to leave the Conservative Party and join UKIP, but that as a matter of honour. Think about that. Politics. Honour.

that as a matter of honour, he would resign his seat in Westminster and ask the people of Clacton whether he had made the right decision. And Douglas, I have to say, for me, and I'm confident that I speak for every man and woman in this room, that is the bravest and noblest thing I have seen in British politics in my lifetime. But please don't think, because Douglas Carswell used to be in the Conservative Party,

that all of UKIP's support is coming from former Conservatives. You can believe that if you read the mainstream national media, because they, rather like our political class, rarely leave the confines of Westminster or its restaurants or bars. Perhaps I shouldn't have said that myself, but never mind.

They would have you believe that we pose a mortal threat to David Cameron's Conservative Party. But because of UKIP, the Conservative Party will not get a majority at the next general election. They're wrong. The reason the Conservative Party will not get a majority at the next election has nothing to do with us. They've done the job themselves, under David Cameron, very capably indeed. But the story that everybody has missed...

And it's the story that began at the Barnsley by-election when Jane stood for us nearly three years ago. The untold story is that actually in the Midlands and the North and elsewhere in the country, in Wales in particular, in the European elections, you know, and in Wales, UKIP topped the poll in Merthyr Tydfil. You know, I mean, and I don't know, I don't know how many kedgereating, retired half-colonels from the cavalry regiments live in Merthyr Tydfil.

But it's pretty obvious from results like that that we are tearing vast chunks out of the old Labour vote too. And so it is perhaps fortuitous that on October the 9th, when Douglas fights the by-election in Clacton, and by the way, did you know that October the 9th was David Cameron's birthday? So wouldn't that be a lovely present for the Prime Minister? Which I hope you'll deliver Douglas when you see him in the House of Commons the next day.

But also we have on that day a by-election being fought in Hayward and Middleton on the outer edge of Greater Rochdale and you've seen just before me John Bickley, our excellent candidate, somebody who comes himself from what he would describe as a working-class Labour voting background standing for UKIP, an excellent candidate and if you believe the story is coming out

of the Manchester Conference from the Labour Party, we've now got the Labour Party as worried up in Hayward and Middleton as we've got the Conservative Party worried in Clacton. This party is not about left and right. This party is about right and wrong. And so it is no coincidence

that we're holding our party conference this year here in this magnificent Doncaster racecourse. Why are we in Doncaster? Well it's quite simple. Because Ed Miliband is one of the town's MPs and we want to signal to the world that we are now parking our tanks on the Labour Party's lawn for too long now.

Much of the north of England, in its towns and cities, has resembled a one-party state. Towns and cities in which the local Labour authorities and the sitting Labour MPs have absolutely massive majorities. Towns and cities in which the opposition that used to be provided by the Liberal Democrats and by the Conservative Party has frankly melted away to such an extent that they don't even pose a threat.

And with massive majorities and with the one party state, what you get is complacency. And what you get with complacency is indeed a form of corruption. And the first specimen of that we saw in the North was indeed the Donnygate scandal of ten years ago. But that was as nothing to what Labour have now done to much of the North of England.

the total and absolute corruption of our voting system through the establishment back in 2000 of a postal voting system. A postal voting system that has led to fraud, that has led now to intimidation, that has rendered some of our by-elections almost pointless to contest. I mean, think about it. Earlier on this year in the by-election of Wythenshawe,

nominations for candidates closed on the 29th of January and the postal votes were received on the 1st of February. No opportunity for the voters to see the election addresses or to even meet the canvases of the other parties. And no criticism of this do we get from the Liberal Democrats or the Conservatives because actually they are using the postal voting system in their strong areas too. And one of the commitments I will absolutely make

is that when we get Westminster MPs for UKIP, we will campaign for postal voting to be available to people who are elderly, infirm, work overseas or are in the armed forces, but ordinarily we think that people who want to vote should go down to the local primary school and pick up a pencil and put a cross on a piece of paper. But Labour's failure in the north of England, of course, is even worse and even more serious

than the postal voting scandal. What we have seen in Rotherham in particular, but there have been other examples of it too, what we have seen within the one party state of Labour as a direct result of their national policies and as a direct result of their own political correctness at local level is child abuse that has taken place on a scale

that I think is actually difficult for decent people to even comprehend. I think it is just about one of the most shocking things that I've seen in my lifetime in this country. And what we learn, and what's emerged from the witness testimony of people in those councils and even sitting MPs and former MPs is that because they were so scared of causing a division

Within the very multicultural society that they had created they were more fearful of being branded racist than they were of taking on and tackling an evil that existed within that town and that is wrong that is wrong and it and it shows why we need opposition it shows why we need a change in our political culture and I know that some people are saying to me Nigel it's wrong you shouldn't be saying these things

You shouldn't be making this political. This is simply a cultural problem. Well, I'm sorry, but if this isn't political, then what is? So our message is that here in the north of England...

And following on, I hope, John, from a fantastic by-election result in Hayward and Middleton, here in the north of England, many of our target seats will be seats that are currently held by sitting Labour MPs. And tomorrow afternoon, what I will do in my speech is I will show you some of the polling that I've done in northern and southern constituencies over the course of this last week, which will show you that we pose a threat

not just to the Conservative Party, as the papers would have you believe. We pose a threat to the entire British political class, and I'll drink to that. Now, I think we've pretty clearly established ourselves in this country as to what our position is as far as Europe and the European Union's concerned. We love Europe, but we hate the European Union. Alright, it's very simple. I think people know what our position is when it comes to immigration.

You know, we're not against immigration, but we believe the British government should be able to control both the quantity and the quality of those that come into this country. These things are well known and understood. And what you've seen over the course of today is a broadening of our policy base from our excellent new spokesmen and spokeswomen. What you've seen today is the road towards

the manifesto that we will fight the 2015 general election on. And I just want to pick one area, I mean I could pick all of them, but one area that I think comes out of today that is really, really important. And it's a banner that absolutely every one of you who is out there standing or campaigning for UKIP must carry. And it is what Patrick O'Flynn said this morning about the need for their TOTAC

earning the minimum wage in this country. That must be something we carry from here into every election because how could it be right? How could it be right to give people disincentives to get off benefit and to get back into work? And how could it be right that for so many people the minimum wage has actually become the maximum wage?

because of the massive oversupply of labour coming into this country. And it also cannot be right that our political class in Westminster simply seem to be unable to comprehend and understand what the effects of wage compression have been on people's lives. You know, I was out this morning

visiting a factory not too far from here. We popped into the local CAF. I met a couple of guys there and they all said the same thing. They all said we're taking home less money than we were 10 years ago. We're living in divided communities. We don't feel happy with the country we're living in and we want change. And I think that new tax agenda is something we must take out to the country.

And part of our battle against the Labour Party has to be that we confront this myth. The Labour Party will tell everybody that UKIP wants to privatise the NHS, that UKIP wants to charge you for GP appointments. What they don't tell you is that it's the Labour Party, in government from 1997, that introduced the PFI deals on new-build hospitals, which has cost the taxpayer in this country billions to the benefit of...

of many private firms and investors. So let's fight the Labour Party back on the National Health Service. They've done more than anybody, more than anybody to actually bring private money into the health service and it's not UKIP that'll do it. And on policy, yes I nearly forgot, the deficit, that's right. And on the deficit, and again I'm repeating what Patrick said this morning, but leaving the...

will save us £10 billion a year and that's just on the membership fee, let alone the opportunity cost that we will have from being able to now embrace the world, to make trade relationships with people who speak our language and who have common law. The benefits of taking back our fisheries, but most of all the benefits of removing the excessive regulation.

be it employment legislation, be it health and safety at work, be it environmental legislation, I do not believe that Britain's 4.6 million men and women, brave men and women, that are running our small businesses or acting as sole traders should be made to abide by the same rulebook as Unilever and Tesco. We've got to lift the weight of burden off the back. Now, of course, to some extent, there are those that will argue

that today's conference for UKIP has been slightly overshadowed by events taking place in Westminster. And I'm not going to speculate on the timing of that. I don't find it unusual at all. Because I noticed that the day after Mr. Carswell joined us, we were told that the nation was on a state of emergency. So I kind of...

expect these things to happen. If beginning the bombing missions was that important, why couldn't they have met yesterday? But never mind. I just want to remind people of what we've done in terms of our foreign policy over the course of the last decade and more. You know, we went to Afghanistan because we were going to make that a better place and make the streets of Britain safer. Do you remember all that? And then we went to war in Iraq in 2003.

believing that we could topple Saddam Hussein and impose our model of Western democracy upon three very, very different tribal cultures in a country that was originally drawn in the Foreign Office with a ruler and a pencil. And arguably, we haven't made life in Iraq better for anybody. Perhaps most extraordinarily stupid of all is we bombed Libya. Do you remember? We bombed Libya.

It was the big moment for Sarkozy and for Cameron. And because we hadn't got any aircraft carriers, we were actually doing 3,500 mile round trips from North Norfolk to bomb Libya.

And nearly everybody in Westminster agreed. In fact, only 12 members of Parliament voted against us bombing Libya. And without any shadow of a doubt, Libya is now a very much worse country than it was before we bombed it, with its Parliament now actually having to meet on a boat

because it's not safe to meet on land with Christians fleeing in fear of their lives and nearly every single one of those boats attempting to cross the Mediterranean and those loss of hundreds of lives all coming from Libya. And then a year ago, a year ago, do you remember what was happening a year ago? What the Prime Minister proposed was that we armed the rebels in Syria against President Assad. And it turns out

that many of those that we were going to arm have now morphed into the very people that we could be bombing by Saturday morning. In short, what I'm saying to you is our foreign policy has been a total and utter shambles. Now, I can see, I can see

that with the development of Islamic State it is actually rather easier now than it's been at any point in the last 15 years to say this is bad, this is evil, this is wrong. But believe me folks,

Joining a bombing mission as Johnny-come-late Liz to back up the American president and to think that by just dropping bombs somehow in one country somehow we are going to solve that problem is gravely, gravely mistaken. You cannot win wars just by bombing. And when you bomb, you will necessarily kill a large number of civilians in doing so.

and I think once again we are entering into military action without having fully thought through what the consequences are. If the Prime Minister

if the Prime Minister today had made it clear that actually what we were going to do was to form a grand coalition and to do it with Iraq and to do it with Syria and to do it with Nigeria and Kenya and Algeria and that we were going to work with those Arab and African states and that they were going to provide the boots on the ground to initially fight a battle of containment and perhaps ultimately over the long term one of victory and that our role in this

was to provide knowledge, expertise, help and moral support, then I would have voted had I been there with the Prime Minister today. But he has done no such thing. We are launching ourselves off into another bombing mission. And when I hear Mr Cameron telling us that by doing this it will make the streets of Britain safer, well I'm sorry,

but actually I suspect it'll make the streets of Britain rather less safe than they currently are today. Everything that I see from Islamic State says to me that they've actually been teasing us. They actually want us to go in and bomb them and then declare some big great jihad in this or any other country. So I do not believe that today's strategy is the right one. And I also wonder a bit about the home front.

We're busy fighting wars abroad, but what about the home front? What about the radicalisation that has been taking place in our schools, in our prisons? What about the collapse in national self-confidence in much of our leadership? You know, with the last Archbishop of Canterbury even suggesting that we should find and accept Sharia law in Britain's cities.

Well, I agree with you, no. But the point I'm making is, I think actually, the battle, the battle on the home front is really rather an important one, and one in which we have failed very badly. The multi...

the multicultural experiment, the attempt by the state to divide everybody up and keep them separate has been a disaster. It is not what anybody in this country wants and we must be the party that says we put this behind us and we don't care what colour or religion or where people come from, they must be here together in one Britain, together, equal before the law. That is the home front fight that we must win.

And on the home front, we are living through a time and through a period of the most extraordinary political change. The events in Scotland were astonishing, weren't they? An 86% turnout, all of which goes to show that if you actually make politics important, if you make voting relevant, then people will go out and do so.

But the aftermath of that referendum is once again we saw our three leaders get the whole thing completely and utterly wrong through arrogance and through complacency and through their refusal to recognize that the devolution genie is out of the bottle and it's not going to get put. And I'm sorry, but those promises...

that were made on behalf of non-Scottish voters across the rest of the United Kingdom were, as far as I'm concerned, not legitimate and not made in my name. We cannot go on. We cannot go on like this. We cannot go on.

with situations like British English students paying tuition fees because the majority of Scottish MPs voted for them whilst at the same time youngsters in Scotland don't have to pay any tuition fees at all. I know that Mr Cameron did in the aftermath of the referendum promise that he would deliver for England

But I've heard Mr Cameron make promises on England and on Europe and on many other things before and we must hold his feet to the fire because we must fight that election next year absolutely insisting that whilst we believe in a united kingdom

And whilst we are the only UK political party with elected representation in all four corners of the kingdom, we believe that English MPs only must vote on English laws and that has to come to pass. We're living through a period of change.

We're part of a party that I think is an exciting, positive part of that change. And we've talked today about our broader policy manifesto. But I will make a prediction today, ladies and gentlemen. I think the issue that will dominate next year's general election, whether we want it or not, will be the issue of open-door immigration.

It will be, and I say that because the figures are getting higher and higher and higher with every single quarter that passes. We are borderless Britain. And for the other three to even try and pretend that they can control the numbers that come into Britain is them, frankly, not telling the truth. You cannot control your own borders and be a member of the European Union. It is not possible. And if I look at the economic situation in Greece,

and in Italy and in Portugal and in Spain, I fear the numbers that come will get greater and greater. I don't blame youngsters from Italy or Spain for wanting to come here. I do the same thing. But it's no good for our young people and it's no good for our working people to suffer from wage compression, from unemployment and to see a level of social change in our communities that we simply can't keep up with. It is no good

for Labour or the Tories to pretend that a British government can estimate how many primary school places we need, can tell us what healthcare provision we need, if they don't know themselves, within the nearest couple of million, how many people will be living here in five years' time. We must take back control of our borders and manage our own immigration policy. And that policy, I think, will win us many votes in the general election.

You know, earlier this year, in April, in March actually, I was challenged by Nick Clegg, I was challenged by Nick Clegg to do a couple of television debates. And I never thought I'd say it. I never thought there'd ever be a situation where I could stand before you and say that I think the biggest boost

that has ever been given to me and to UKIP was by Nick Clegg because for the first time in nearly 40 years we debated on national television what the European project was actually about. So a big round of applause please for Nick Clegg. And I said at the end of that, come and join our people's army to sweep aside like a new broom

the establishment that has failed us so badly in this country. I was right then and I'm right now and the opportunities that are before us are quite extraordinary and I'm bored and I'm sick to death with being told if you vote UKIP you'll split the vote.

If you vote UKIP you'll get Labour and indeed in parts of South Essex now the Labour Party in by-elections say if you vote UKIP you'll get Conservative and the message that needs to come out from this conference is that actually in our target seats next year in the by-elections and in the general election if you vote UKIP you will get UKIP and if we get this right

And if we win enough seats in that Parliament, in what is going to be a tight general election, we could even say to people, ""Vote UKIP to hold the balance of power."" And if we hold the balance of power, there won't just be a referendum on our EU membership, there will be a culture change in British politics. It'll be a kind of politics that actually represents ordinary men

and women in this country. It'll be a politics of change. It'll be a politics that is far better than the one we have today. So I'm going to say to people from this conference, let's go out there, let's fight.

In our People's Army, hard on the ground, a tremendous potential prize awaits us. It has been my privilege and my honour to lead you into us winning a national election. And I believe actually the most exciting phase of UKIP's story is about to begin. Thank you very, very much indeed.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9998713731765747,0.0,0.0,0.0,Populist

I thought well we've won the referendum 85% of us have voted for parties in the general election who say they will honour the result of the referendum and then 498 of them have said it's going to happen. I did actually rather stupidly for a moment believe that we'd won but it became clear

pretty early on really, with the so-called negotiation, that our Remainer Parliament, our Remainer Cabinet, and indeed our Remainer Prime Minister, were going to do their utmost to delay, dilute, and in many cases to actually stop and overturn Brexit. And I think what we've seen over the course of the last few weeks is the betrayal, willful betrayal,

of the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation. And when I began to realise back in November, December, that extension was almost certain to come, that there would be more European elections, I thought, I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to set up a party. I'm going to call it the Brexit Party. But given that it's the most googled word in the English language,

I wonder whether the Electoral Commission will allow me to use the name. Well, they have, and you are here today at the birth, at the launch of a new force in British politics. Welcome to the Brexit Party. I haven't spent 25 years of my life...

fighting to raise the issue of why we should be an independent, normal, self-governing country that makes its own laws, has its own courts, controls its own borders. I haven't spent 25 years of my life doing that, to simply roll over and to allow a career political class to betray that result without me fighting back. Well, the fight back begins here in Coventry today.

And I think what's happened is our two-party system simply can't cope with Brexit. I think our two-party system has been exposed, frankly, as being unfit for purpose. I think we have a Parliament that is now completely out of touch with our country. I think politics is broken. And I want to say this: this party is not here just to fight the European elections.

on the 23rd of May this year. This party is not here to ask people simply to express their anger by going to the ballot box and voting for us on that day. No, no. The 23rd of May is the first step of the Brexit party. Our task and our mission is to change politics for good, to change all aspects of politics in this country.

I did say, I did say that if I ever had to come back into the political fray next time, it'd be no more Mr. Nice Guy. And I mean it. I mean it. I mean it. Yes, I'm angry about what's happened. I know lots of people out there are angry.

But this is not, as I say, a negative emotion. This is a positive emotion. We're going to use these elections to change things. I said many years ago that I wanted to cause an earthquake in British politics. Well, now, what I'm fighting for, and with your support, what we will attempt to achieve is a democratic revolution in British politics, because that is what we need. Now, even before we've launched the party...

one or two very interesting and exciting things have begun to happen. Just over ten days ago, the website went live and we said to people, ""If you want to sign up as registered supporters, if you want to donate money to the party, we're open for business."" And I think it's pretty remarkable that in the first ten days of operation,

We've managed to raise over three quarters of a million pounds from small donations from members of the public. I've never seen anything like that in my 25 years of campaigning. And when I was asked this morning on the Today programme, on the BBC Today programme, I was asked what big donors do we have?

I said, ""Well, of course I'd welcome big donors, but wouldn't it be even more exciting if it was hundreds of thousands of small donors that funded the rebirth of democracy in this country?"" Because that is what it's about. It's about democracy. Our democratic decision is being willfully overturned, and this is coming in the country that has what was once called the mother of parliaments.

And I can tell you that all over the world, our friends, and I do know one or two quite highly placed politicians in some other English-speaking countries of the world. All over the world, people look on with incredulity because they still think that we're a great country. And the funny thing is that we the people still think that we're a great country.

But our leaders, our leaders are happy to continue down the path of managed decline. I genuinely believe right now this nation, we are lions led by donkeys. And not only are our leaders weak, not only have they willfully betrayed this result, but they're also pretty much incompetent.

They're not actually very good at what they do. They're not very good at anything. Too many of them, too many of them have been down the path of going straight from Oxford to become a researcher, to become a member of parliament in their late 20s. They've got no experience of the real world. They are classic career politicians because to them, getting re-elected matters more than anything else. They're not in politics.

out of passion, they're not in politics out of a cause and in many ways you can understand why career politicians would embrace the European project. It's a wonderful safety net for anybody that fails in national politics but they do look incompetent and what I've been astonished by with the Brexit party is the quality of people who've now decided enough's enough. The quality of people

who are putting their names forward to be candidates for this European election and thousands more already who've applied to stand for us in local elections, in general elections, in by-elections and whatever else it may be. And I also want to emphasise that amongst this remarkable talent we've got from men and women who will be standing on our list, and I do believe

that the list that we will put before the British public on May the 23rd will be the most impressive list of candidates any political party has ever put before the British public in history. I genuinely believe that and I mean that.

We have many people on these lists who do deals every day, who do deals every week. So it's time the political class, who've shown themselves incapable of doing a good deal, were pushed aside and replaced by those who know how the real world works.

Of course there'll be questions about broader issues of policy and we'll come to that in time. But for now we are focused on the 23rd of May. For now we are focused on this question of democracy, this question of trust and indeed this question of competence. How are we going to do? Well I don't know. But I have been to the bookmakers this morning.

And I remember in the run-up to the referendum, when it was 4-1 against Leave winning, and I went into bookmakers in London and put down a bet. Oh, and how everybody thought it was so terribly funny. Well, I did manage to collect my winnings, and I have this morning put £1,000 on the Brexit Party to top the poll in the European election at the odds of 3-1.

Who's to say? I don't know. All I can say... All I can say...

is this first step in our journey to change politics for the good, this first beginning of this fight back, all I can say is we are going to provide the British people with a decent, respectable, competent political vehicle that they can believe in and they can vote for. And after that, well, it's not up to us, is it? It's then up to the public in this country. I think...

I think we're going to set something exciting, a spark. It's going to happen over the course of the next few weeks. I do believe that we can win these European elections and that we can again start to put the fear of God into our members of Parliament in Westminster. They deserve nothing less than that after the way they've treated us over this betrayal.

I really do believe that Britain needs the Brexit party and we'll do whatever we can over the course of the next few weeks to provide that respectable vehicle for those who want us. And let's just remind ourselves what this referendum was about. It wasn't about some economic prognosis from the CBI that we might be worse off or a view of many of the entrepreneurs that support us that we're going to be a lot better off. It wasn't about that.

The referendum was a very simple choice. Did we wish to stay part of a political union or did we wish to become an independent, self-governing nation? And we, Leavers in this country, none of them have changed their minds. In fact, in many ways, the Leave vote has hardened in this country. And there are equally many people who voted remain.

who believe that democracy is so fundamental to this country, to who we are as a people, that unless the will of the people is carried out, something would have changed in our nation forever. So I think, with a bit of luck and a following wind, trying our hardest, I think we can turn this around. I know this is a battle that we shouldn't be having to fight.

but we are having to fight it and we are going to win it. Thank you. Now let me introduce you to a selection, just a handful of the 70 candidates that will be standing for us in England, Scotland and Wales on May the 23rd. And can I please welcome to the stage, Annunciata Rees-Mogg.

Hello, as Nigel has said, my name is Anunsiata Rees-Mogg and I am here today in sadness. I am here in sadness that our democracy has been so betrayed that I feel the need to be here. For the last eight years I've been a full-time mother. I didn't think I would ever be back on the political scene. I wanted to avoid the negative comments that people throw

all over the place and the violence that can come from putting your name above the parapet and standing for what you believe in. I didn't want my children to have to suffer that but my country needs to be recognised in the democratic way that it has called for. Our politicians need to listen to what the people have said. I joined the Conservative Party in 1984.

This is not a decision I have made lightly, to leave a party for which I have fought at every election since 1987, from Maggie Thatcher through to Theresa May. I know which one I'd rather have representing us now. Within the Conservative Party, there have been good times, but there have been quite bleak times, where I wondered what our leaders were doing and I had serious questions.

but I stuck by them through thick and thin. But at the point at which our Prime Minister will not listen not only to her membership, but will not listen to the people of her country, 17.4 million of them, many of whom had never voted before, but believed in bringing back control, I can't sit by and let her do it. It is our fight and we must fight to win.

There have been scare stories left, right and centre. Oddly, we seem to have less to fear from WTO than the EU. It is them that should be trying to avoid it. When it comes to tariffs, the majority of the world operates on WTO and it is the world that is growing as Europe and the European Union economies stagnate.

We should be looking further afield. We should not have fear, we should have belief. We know we are a great nation and for that we should be proud. We should stand up, we should fight for our futures, for our children's futures, but most importantly we should trust the people. In 2003 I founded a campaign called Trust the People because it's what I so fundamentally believe in.

We've got to rescue our democracy. We have got to show that the people of this country have a say in how we are run. That the politicians are not our masters, they are to do our bidding. We must fight back not only of control from the European Union, but fight back for control of our own democracy. The stakes are that high. This is a fundamental moment

for all of us. For our futures and to shape how things go forward, I cannot put up with the despondency on the streets. I cannot bear to see the anger amongst the people this country's elected members have ignored. We must fight their fight. We must win the fight. And we must leave for a greater future and better politics. Thank you.

Thank you very much. And I was also asked this morning on the Today programme whose votes will we be targeting? Will we be targeting Tory votes? Will we be targeting Labour votes? And the truth of it is we're targeting the millions of people out there who voted Conservative and who voted Leave. We're targeting millions of people who in previous times voted UKIP and voted Leave. And we're not going to forget for one minute the five million people out there

who voted to leave and who also voted Labour. Very, very important we get that message out there. Very important indeed. Let me introduce my next candidate to the stage, Ben Habib. Well, thank you, Malcolm, for welcoming us to your industrial facilities in the heartlands of the manufacturing sector in Great Britain. I am delighted to be here. My name is Ben Habib. I'm founder and chief executive of a company called First Property Group.

I've been very politically aware all my life. I've been a Tory voter and more recently a Tory donor. I've never been politically active, but the reason I have stood up today and joined the Brexit Party is essentially because of this document. I just want to remind you all about this document. It was a document that David Cameron circulated at a cost of £9.4 million in the run-up to the referendum.

23 pages long, 22 pages dedicated to all the fear that we must take on board if we were to leave the European Union. But two very critical points were made in this document. The first was, and I'll just read it to you, ""The government will implement what you decide."" And secondly, that ""This is the vote of a generation."" The government didn't proceed to deliver what we decided.

The government proceeded, well, in David Cameron's case, he resigned virtually immediately. Theresa May made a couple of good speeches at the outset, which was very encouraging for people like me. And then she proceeded to slip-slide to the awful position in which the United Kingdom now finds itself. I do deals for a living. That's precisely what I do do. And the last thing I will ever do is take no deal off the table. It's absolutely bonkers. APPLAUSE

If you take no deal off the table, what you're signalling to your counterparty is that you will sign, and it's a logical consequence, you will sign any deal that they put in front of you. In other words, Parliament has condemned this country to unconditional surrender.

I have a one minute warning, so I've got to be brief. But I want to talk a bit about the, I want to talk very briefly about the economy. The whole Remain argument centres on the economy. Every day in the run up to the referendum we heard about what a disaster it would be if we voted to leave. Well that disaster didn't happen. Every day now we hear about what a disaster it would be if we were to leave without a no deal.

I heard the Chancellor on Sophie Ridge the other day saying that it would be catastrophic if we left without a deal. He's our flipping Chancellor. He shouldn't allow the country to get to a position where it could be catastrophically bad for us. But let me tell you, there is nothing to be feared from no deal.

People don't trade with the United Kingdom because we're in the European Union They trade with the United Kingdom because they have they want to buy our goods They want to sell us their goods trade deals are not a prerequisite for trade They just are nice to have we will be absolutely fine without a deal with the European Union I've run my business successfully through the boom period as well as the credit crunch economies change

Markets change, legislation changes, social behaviour changes, buying pattern changes, internet and the technological environment in which we operate change. Businesses are subject to change all the time. If we think the imposition of a small number of tariffs is going to knock Great Britain off its legs, then we've lost the plot and I'm out of time. That's all I have to say. Thank you. APPLAUSE

Well, just to back up Ben's point, as Malcolm Penny showed me around the factory this morning, I saw some of the spray painting work that was going on, and I said, well, where are those goods destined for? The United States of America, with whom we trade under WTO rules. It's not that difficult, really, is it? I want to introduce to you our next candidate, who is June Mummery. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning, Coventry.

My name is June Mummery, business owner and founding member of Reef, renaissance of the East Anglin fisheries. I represent fishermen from Kings Lynn all the way down to the Thames estuary. I have been fighting continuously for the past two and a half years to secure a brighter future for our coastal communities post Brexit, which have been left behind by governments past and present.

I want to ensure this changes. Brexit is a golden opportunity to rejuvenate our fishing industry, realise our vast potential to become as successful as Norway, Faroe and Iceland. We have a vision and a sustainable plan to make our coastal towns prosper once again. We must take back full control of our precious ocean and the fish within it.

There are billions of pounds worth of fish to be caught and processed in our country, creating jobs and wealth. One job at sea produces eight jobs on land. The UK fishing industry could be worth a staggering £1.6 billion catch value and £6.3 billion net-to-plate value. I have lobbied hard towards the banning of electric pulse fishing

exercised by the Dutch fishing fleet in community waters. This barbaric, unethical method of fishing kills the biodiversity that makes up the very ecology of our sea. Our campaign has been a success. Pulse fishing is to be banned in the sea. Our campaign has been absolutely wonderful. Our campaign has been a very big success. Pulse fishing is banned.

in our European waters, this is first-hand evidence of what passionate UK citizens can achieve when we work together. The UK has some of the richest fishing grounds in the world. We are tired of watching the Dutch, French and other EU countries plunder our natural resource. We wear the crown and we are throwing the diamonds, emeralds and rubies away.

We must scrap the common fishery policy, take back control of our waters and take full control of our country and our destiny to make our country great again. June, thank you. And our next candidate is Alka Segal Cuthbert. Hello, I'm Alka Segal Cuthbert and I'm a teacher. I've tried...

to be not too teachery. But I do think it's worth having a little bit of a historical perspective which will explain why I think we need to leave the EU and why I'm standing. I think the question of democracy is central. It's taken centuries for societies to go from being ruled by myths and taboos to monarchs who rule by divine right to social democratic forms of governance.

which are based on the majority vote and where the governments get their legitimacy from their citizens through democratic mandates.

Think it's one put you know the idea of one pet citizens vote being equivalent to any others irrespective of religion employment status cultural preferences or what have you that fundamental principle has been the basis of equality and the basis of a level of social solidarity That made Britain a place that my dad wanted to come to in the early 60s from India. He was a teacher and

He stood as a local Labour candidate probably the first non-white in that particular London suburb at the time And he came not for money and not for access to services But he came because of that democratic principle principle that respected democracy and autonomy as a general rule for everybody not just if you were rich or if you're academically qualified or if you had the right beliefs and

And I think since the referendum and all the developments subsequent, we've seen that even as an ideal,

That principle of democracy is so weak it doesn't really exist anymore because over the past quarter of a century our political class, that's from all parties, have spent their time and efforts, along with their friends in Europe, to create an institutional structure of political regulation that in the words of one academic who I am happy to quote, has depoliticized the economy and de-democratized politics. And that's had...

That is not just a question that does not just affect the narrow sphere of politics in Parliament that has had ramifications throughout our lives because our institutional Professions our institutional structures have been recast. You know, these are things through which most people live our lives mums teachers nurses

fishmongers, everybody lives their lives through these institutions and they have been recast from away from democratic principles into technocratic,

rule-bound things that kind of squeeze the space for human judgment and human experience. And the effects of that, I think, as a teacher, I've seen how that's affected my profession, and I know people who work in the healthcare, and their profession is similarly affected, not just by material cutbacks, but by a profound demoralization. And I think it's time to re-democratize and re-moralize politics. I don't think...

I don't think parties who are committed to technocratic forms of governments can do it. I don't think academics can do it, even if they're from Harvard or Cambridge where I studied. I think it can only be done through the widest public engagement. The process has been started already, not by

Nigel, powerful as he is and charismatic as he may be to some, but it's actually been done by everybody, and I mean everybody who voted in the referendum, whether it was remain or leave, right? And so this isn't just about that anymore. It's about respecting that democratic vote. The

the Remainers might have been aligned with the political class this time, but if they let this democratic principle go, next time when you vote, who's to say the government will respect anything, right? So it can't be...

It can't be done by them. It's got to be done as the taxi drivers in Luton are discovering as they're struggling to maintain their living standards. It can only be done by ourselves, not ourselves as frightened, isolated individuals, fearful for our reputations. But we've got to understand ourselves as citizens who are equal. We're able to argue. We're able to find points of consensus, as well as realise through arguing what is non-negotiable

and through that process, through that messy human political process, arrive at consensus decisions, which we did in that referendum. It's called independent thinking, it's called democracy, and I think it's worth fighting for.

Alka, thank you. Well, they're just four of the candidates that will be standing for us on the 23rd of May. I hope you agree with me. We've got some very, very capable and able people that are going to be running for this party. Somebody, people actually of quality that our voters can go out and vote for. I think they're all terrific. But there's one more.

I must introduce you to our final speaker of the morning, who also is going to be standing in the European elections on our list and takes over from this moment as party chairman, which means I've got far less to do. So I'm delighted. Please welcome Richard Tice. It's all been fine. I didn't say anything. Just carry on, Richard.

Good morning. Thank you, Nigel. And thank you, firstly, to reiterate the thanks to the Penny family for hosting us here so warmly and generously. It is wonderful to be amongst a long-standing family business, the sort of business that actually is the bedrock of the UK economy and of which we should be incredibly proud.

I've been a businessman and an entrepreneur for over 30 years. I've been involved in running small, medium and large companies, including a billion pound multinational business listed on the stock market where we tripled the share price in just four years. I've built thousands of homes. I've been involved in creating tens and tens of thousands of jobs in the construction centre.

in the construction sector and I've attracted hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds of investment into this country from overseas. And I've been a lifelong member of the Conservative Party. But like many, I've concluded that frankly, enough is enough. We cannot, we cannot, we must not and we will not allow this complete and utter shambles in Westminster to continue.

We all know that the UK can do so much better than this. And that's why I've agreed to chair the new Brexit party. And let's just take a step back and just pause for a moment amongst all the noise and the angst. Let's just remember, let's celebrate the fact that we are an incredibly proud, strong, confident, amazing country. Let's just celebrate that. Amongst all the noise in Westminster, we forget...

We're one of the top six economies in the world. We're a permanent member of the G7, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, part of the Five Eyes Security Network. We're the head of the amazing Commonwealth countries around the world. We have the best trained armed forces in the world, three of the top ten universities. London is the greatest capital city in the world with one of the leading financial centres. These are huge achievements to celebrate.

We also, of course, have the greatest football league in the world. And despite all the noise again, people forget, in 2018, thanks to Brexit, this great economy of ours outperformed Germany, France, Italy. We're employing record numbers of people. Unemployment is at record lows. And thanks to Brexit, wages are increasing faster than inflation. So we have so much to be optimistic about.

And yet our current crop of politicians seem to be pessimistic. We are poised to go from strength to strength. But that, ladies and gentlemen, requires confident, bold, optimistic leadership. What we've had, and instead of that, we've seen an utter, total humiliation on the international stage. The absurd sight of our Prime Minister writing not one, but two begging letters

to overseas leaders in the space of a fortnight. You literally couldn't make it up if you were writing a fiction book. We have an incompetent government, incapable negotiating teams and politicians who say and write one thing in a manifesto and then conspire amongst themselves to do dodgy, dirty, backroom deals in Westminster. Many politicians seem happy

to sell our country, this great nation, down the river by tying us, strapping us into a straitjacket with this woeful withdrawal agreement. It is truly the worst deal in history, and yet they recommend that we sign it. And not only would this straitjacket have a padlock, but the key to that padlock would be given to bureaucrats in Brussels. You really couldn't make it up.

And the other people that have been found out in this process are the civil service. They're not up to the job. And only this morning we learned that yesterday politicians and the civil service seem to think that it's a good idea to stop no-deal preparations.

You couldn't make it up, ladies and gentlemen. They should be ramping it up. They should be using this time to make sure that all the T's are crossed, all the I's are dotted, so that not only are we ready, but actually we're going to leave on a WTO Brexit, because that is the way that we maximise our negotiating leverage. That's the way to get the best deal for this country, not to stop no-deal preparations. As Ben said earlier, that is an appalling business negotiating tactic.

And as we sit here, we'll stand here today, it's unbelievable that in this country, the mother of all democracies, the very essence of trust in democracy is being destroyed. And it's utterly tragic when thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who never voted before, they showed that confidence in the referendum. And now they're questioning saying, why would we ever bother to vote again? Enough is enough.

That's why, ladies and gentlemen, we must fight back. That's why, ladies and gentlemen, we must change politics for good in this country. Because we all know... We all know... We all know that this country deserves so much better. That's why the Brexit Party is going to do things differently. We stand for competent, capable, common-sense politics. We know that Brexit creates a huge opportunity

for optimism, for growth, for renewal in the United Kingdom. We've just got to grasp it. It's time we took on the vested interests. It's time we took on the establishment. It's time we took on the civil service. We need to change fundamentally the way this country is run so that it's run for the people.

Never again, never again, ladies and gentlemen, should we ever, ever allow ourselves to be humiliated in this way. But if we carry on under this current leadership, we know what will happen. We'll be here on the 31st of October, Halloween night, and we'll be writing another begging letter. It must stop. So that's why...

That's why we are so proud of the incredible quality of hundreds and hundreds of applicants to stand as candidates for this new party.

And it's great to see the first four that we announced today. And as we announce the remaining candidates over the next couple of weeks, you will see specialist skills, real knowledge, great experience, success from entrepreneurs, from academics, from doctors, from people from the military. That's the sort of quality that we need to bring into politics to make this difference.

And not only did hundreds and hundreds of people apply to be candidates, but it is deeply humbling that thousands and thousands and thousands of people across the country have online made donations to help start this new movement, this new party. That is deeply humbling for those of us that are leading it. And it's also extraordinary the number of activists and volunteers and local associations of other political parties

who've been phoning up saying can we help can we get involved what do we need to do we're with you just tell us when something is changing there is a huge movement ladies and gentlemen this is a time to change politics for good in this country and we say

To anybody that says, well these EU elections are not worth voting for, why should I bother? I'll tell you why you should bother. Everybody, for the first time, should vote in these elections. Because this is an opportunity to send a very clear, very strong, very powerful message to Westminster. It's a chance for a springboard to transform politics. People want change. People want better people running our country. Better leaders.

People want quality people spending taxpayers' money, our money, wisely, better, and to stop the waste. People want faster decisions. In the world of business, we have a can-do, make-things-happen sort of approach. And that's what we need for the people running this country. If this country was run like a well-run, lean, successful business, we would all be in a much, much better place. So I say to you...

Never has the opportunity been greater. Never has the appetite for change been stronger. We can do this. We can restore trust in democracy, which is absolutely fundamental. We can send a very clear, positive message to Westminster. We can make Brexit an incredible success. We just need new, quality leadership.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's believe in Britain. So that's enough from me. I may have gone on a little bit. We're passionate about this stuff. And I'm sure also that no doubt members of the press and anybody are passionate to ask some questions. So who would like to kick off? Hi.

Back in 2010, there was a phrase, ""We believe in Nick."" The millennials paid for the mistrust in that individual. What I see here... Good morning. Greatly... Not on. Mike, finish you. Do your best. In 2010, there was a slogan, ""I believe in Nick."" The greatest representation to the millennials, as we know, is a generation.

when is a social policy coming forward

You don't want to fall into the trap, my friend, of the haves affecting the have-nots. It is the have-nots that protect this party board, and I urge you to make that representation. Bring the people to the table of the board, and not more of the same. The point I made to you was this, that our first electoral test is going to be on the 23rd of May. It's going to be

European election. It's going to be a European issue. It's also going to be a proportional representation election. And we're going to fight those European elections on democracy, on trust, and on competence. All right? And I promise you,

I promise you we will put out the beginnings of a broader manifesto thereafter and yes, we will put the British people first and give everybody opportunity and of course our policies will have a social dimension, I promise you of that. Yes, there we go. Grace, have you got someone just there? Yes.

Hi there. Josh Halliday from The Guardian. Nigel, how is the Brexit Party different from UKIP? And aren't you in danger of helping the two legacy parties, as you call them, by splitting the pro-Brexit vote? Well, look, I mean, I think that UKIP and the Brexit Party are very different. UKIP was a big part of my life. I was a member of it for 26 years. Indeed, I gave it many of the best years of my adult life. And we did achieve...

I think some pretty remarkable success with it. One of the things that I always did, and yeah sure, I talked about tough issues, I talked about things that others would rather just brush under the carpet, but when I was leader of UKIP, we didn't allow anybody to even be a member if they'd formerly been part of the EDL or the BNP or any organisation like that. In fact, I think we were unique.

political parties and outright banning people from those backgrounds and I'm afraid and I did my very best during the course of last year to warn UKIP not to go down that route they have decided to go down a route where there seems to be a complete obsession not just with Islam but it would appear with it all of its adherence they've attracted a fairly shall I say loutish

fringe, and we certainly saw that when we had the Leave Means Leave rally after the march from Sunderland the other day in Parliament Square. You know, what kicked off with UKIP in Whitehall that evening was pretty unsavoury, and I don't think that Middle England, decent people, want to vote for a political party that is linked to extremism, violence, criminal records and thuggery. That's why I left UKIP. That is why I left UKIP, and it was a difficult thing for me to do, it really was. However,

I now look back at it and think, well, maybe UKIP served its purpose. Maybe it did what it was set up to do. It did precipitate that referendum. But the Brexit Party is not here just to talk about the European issue. The Brexit Party, and the very word Brexit is no longer...

just about leaving the European Union. The word Brexit represents a state of mind. The word Brexit represents the great battle of our day and that battle is the people versus the politicians. That is what Brexit means and this party is not just about going out with the intention of winning those European elections. It's not just about making sure that that referendum is delivered on. We are about fundamentally changing politics in this country.

Hi there, yes. Hi Trish. Because it's the heart of England, that's why. I think it's the easiest question I've ever been asked. We're launching it in the heart of England, we're launching it in a successful family-run business and by doing it here we're sending a message we are a party that understands business, we're a party that understands the importance of business and we're pretty tired of

of the argument that we hear from multinational businesses and career politicians that somehow business is in favour of the customs union, business is in favour of the single market and actually there are vast numbers of businesses out there that do not want to be regulated at a European level and understand as we do there is a bigger, better, more exciting future with a broader world out there.

Hi. Hi, Nigel. I'm Mark Cardwell from SWNS News Agency. Just wanted to ask what your feeling is at the moment about a second referendum and would you be worried that Leave wouldn't win this time? That's another easy question. You cannot have a second referendum until you implement the first referendum. I'm very comfortable. No, no. I'm very happy with a second referendum. We had one in 1975.

and then we have one in 2016 and alright the world moves a bit faster these days give it 20 years have another referendum and that's fine if however

If, however, we're forced into having a second referendum, I think the first thing to say is that the question has to be the right question. The idea that it would be Mrs May's treaty against the existing European treaties would be an outrage, and if that was put to us, well, I did say, actually, that I'd spend the day down the pub, but

I'm a somewhat reformed character now, so what I would do is go and spoil my ballot paper. We have to have a proper question if there is to be a second referendum, and I will say this to you. It is very interesting how large sections of our commentariat and our media are completely ignoring what has happened in the last five weeks in this country, which is a dramatic shift in

in the opinion polls. A dramatic shift towards leaving on WTO terms. Now every single region of England and Wales, with the exception of London, now has majorities, big majorities. In the case of the Midlands, it's a 16% majority of people here who want to leave with no deal as opposed to remaining. So I think we'd win anyway.

Hi, I'm from the Country Observer. You issued a specific appeal to attract business people, people who do deals, entrepreneurs, and to avoid politicians. You're in the traditional industrial heartland, as you said, and we hear very often from chambers of commerce in the region, from prominent business people, that there is a direct threat to thousands of jobs in this region, and market uncertainty caused by Brexit.

What does this party say to those people who are seriously worried about whether they will have a job next year? I mean, your point about market uncertainty is a well-made point. Absolutely. The longer this drags on, the more this Prime Minister kicks the can down the road, the more market uncertainty there is.

Every business has to deal with changing conditions. Every business has to deal with differing social trends. Every business has to deal with different legislation. Every business has to deal, if it trades overseas, with the fact that some of your markets are going through recession and some are going through extraordinary periods of growth. The one thing that I've found, certainly,

speaking to business people, entrepreneurs in business, is they just say, just get it done, get it over with, tell us what the cards are, we will adapt and adjust to whatever those circumstances are. And as for the jobs point, well, you know, we were told by George Osborne, remember him, that if we voted leave, he would have to hold an emergency budget.

that if we voted Leave, half a million jobs would go immediately. The financial sector would lose 300,000 jobs very, very quickly. I mean, he didn't quite tell us that plagues of black locusts would descend upon our land, but it wasn't very far away. And it's been said from this platform already, the one area of the British economy that is suffering is investment.

That is because of the continuing uncertainty and not knowing what resolution there is but by every measure he was wrong and you know the same people who talked to me about the fact jobs could be lost of the same people who told me if we didn't join the euro it would be a catastrophe the same people who told me the exchange rate mechanism would be good for our country and it would be a disaster so you do tend to find that there are two business voices there is a corporate voice and

generally coming from very big companies who want to keep things exactly as they are. They are very happy with European regulation, as much European regulation as possible, because what that does is it actually stops new entrants coming into the market, keeps prices high, so you'll find corporates will be in favour of a regulated European model, but actually amongst SMEs,

and elsewhere, many think there could be huge benefits from us leaving the European Union. Either way, the real answer is, whatever the circumstances are, Britain adapts and we are an entrepreneurial country. We're a global trading nation. We will do absolutely brilliantly in the future. And I feel freed from those shackles, and particularly getting out of the customs union,

and be able to do our own negotiations around the world, why would you tie yourself inextricably to what is just 15% of the world's economy and in 10 years' time might not be much bigger than 5%? Just to reiterate that, let's just remember, despite George Osborne's warnings, we're actually employing over a million people more now than at the time of the referendum. And...

And you talk about chambers of commerce, and let's just think the biggest business group, the CBI.

They have been wrong every single time. They resisted the Thatcherite reforms. They said we shouldn't leave the ERM. Thank heavens we did. They said we should join the Euro. Thank heavens we didn't. And then at the time of the referendum, they said it would be a disaster. It wasn't. It's a springboard to success. Whatever the CBI recommend, ladies and gentlemen, if you do the opposite, you'll be much better off. And it is...

They can't even tell the truth about the size of their own membership. Enough said. So, next question. Thanks very much. Alex Morales from Bloomberg News. Nigel Farage, I was wondering if you could say how much you think the European elections might be a proxy for a second referendum. And you said you put money on the Brexit party. How well do you rate the chances of the pro-Remain, pro-second referendum parties?

Well, it's an interesting question because there are quite a lot. There was a question asked earlier about splitting the vote on the EU withdrawal side with UKIP, and I think I

gave an argument as to why I think the glass ceiling on UKIP is now really quite low. That's my view. When it comes to pro-Remain parties, well, you've got the SNP, pro-Remain, the Greens, pro-Remain, Plaid, pro-Remain, you've got the Liberal Democrats, pro-Remain, you've got Chaka and his chums, pro-Remain.

You've got the Labour Party, well, pretty much now pro-Remain because they want us to stay part of the customs union and basically the single market too. And then you've got the Conservative Party, past, no idea where they stand or anything. So it does seem to me that actually the split in the vote is going to be on the Remain side, it seems to me. Do I think... I don't know. I suppose if I had to have another bet...

Because I like betting, it's good fun. I would bet that Change UK will beat the Liberal Democrats quite comfortably. I think the Liberal Democrat brand looks pretty redundant at the moment. Will this referendum turn into a proxy for a second referendum is a really interesting question. The answer to that can only really be if we have a big turnout. You know, last time the turnout for the European elections was around about 36%. If we get a very big turnout, it could...

But it depends a bit how many votes the Conservatives get because the Conservatives It'll be tough to say whether they're a leave party or a remain party So I don't think it really becomes a proxy for a second referendum But I do think I genuinely do think even if even if the remain parties did well That doesn't really pose a great threat to the Labour Party on its current trajectory Doesn't pose a great threat necessarily to the Conservative Party. But what I do know is that

If the Brexit party does very well, that poses a very big threat to both the Conservative and Labour parties and will shift the centre of gravity of this argument a little bit closer, back towards the people where it needs to be. Nigel, what's your message to Jacob Rees-Mogg and the ERG, apart from joiners? LAUGHTER

I think that when it comes to questions about the Rees-Mogg family, I may leave that to others to answer this morning. Look, I think just as we had the Maastricht rebels back 26, 27 years ago, the ERG have fought a very effective rearguard. But in the end, what they've got to decide is

as Conservative Eurosceptics is, is the Conservative Party the solution to the problem or is the Conservative Party the problem itself? And I decided back after Maastricht that it was the Conservative Party and indeed the Labour Party too that are the problem. And look, I think British politics needs to be realigned. I don't think these two parties frankly can cope.

with Brexit. I don't think the two party system is fit for purpose. And look, I know it's very ambitious. I know it's very bold. But what we are trying to do is change politics for good, completely reshape the British political system. That is our ambition. And you know what? We're going to try our damnedest. We've got two more questions.

Okay, thank you. Alex Thompson, Channel 4 News. Question for Nigel, remarkably. Now, there's a lot of understandable anger directed here this morning against Parliament, but Parliament is only a mirror image of a very divided nation or nations. That gives you a huge problem, as the referendum demonstrated in terms of who voted which way. Surely that gives you a huge problem going into this election. Alka talked about the way democracy works.

that you have a majority in democracy and you respect that majority and you wait for next time if you want to get your own back electorally. That is how our system has evolved, it's how it's worked. The reason we have division in this country, some division in this country, is because a substantial number of the big business and political elites refused to accept the result of the referendum. That is why we have division.

in this country. That is why we have this new breed of person living in Britain, the militant remainer. But actually ask yourself overall, is this country divided? We have a political crisis in this country, absolutely, but we don't have a national crisis in this country. This is not the late 1970s where it was both a political and a national crisis. In fact, and what this polling is showing,

What this big shift in the last five weeks in the opinion polls is showing is that in fact people are coming together and saying one very simple thing: just get on with it. Last question ladies and gentlemen. Jennifer O'Connell from the Irish Times. Question for Nigel. Nigel, if you are... He's popular isn't he? If you are successful in making the case for leaving under WTO rules, how do you propose avoiding a hard border in Ireland and protecting peace on the island?

Well, I don't know who's going to build this hard border because we're not going to build a hard border. The Taoiseach has said that the Republic of Ireland won't build a hard border. Mr Barnier has said that the European Union isn't going to build a hard border. Whether Donald Trump's coming over or not, I'm not really sure. But it is fascinating that...

The European Parliament itself back in early 2017 produced its own report, how to deal with the Irish border in the event of a WTO Brexit. I thought it was fascinating, three weeks ago, when there was speculation about whether we would be leaving under WTO, you know, very firm statements under WTO, both the Commission and Dublin saying there'd be no hard border and yet,

And yet, with the withdrawal treaty, there was the backstop. So look, this is all nonsense. I believe in time. I mean, I do believe the quickest way to a free trade deal, the quickest way to make things easy, particularly for Irish beef farmers and people like that, is we leave on WTO rules. And you know something? The European Union will come running down the street after us wanting a tariff-free deal. But that is how we get there.

The only other issue, of course, would be product standards.

And I understand that because outside the single market we would not be subject to the same rules imposed from Brussels. But you know what? After 44 years of regulatory alignment, the day we leave and actually for a long time afterwards, the products are going to be on the same spec. And because we're leaving the European Union, we are not in this country going to lower our standards to third world level. It simply isn't going to happen. And I think the Irish border very cleverly

was put up by Monsieur Barnier to be this insoluble problem and our Prime Minister, and it's remarkable this if you think about it, on the 8th of December 2017 because of a deadline set by an unelected bureaucrat called Monsieur Barnier

The British Prime Minister left Downing Street at 4:15 in the morning to fly to Brussels to meet his deadline. And there in desperation, she signed up to the backstop and it's been a disaster ever since. All I can say is I wish Barnier was on our side, not Mrs May. I'm just going to finish on this point. People underestimate the European Union's own expert

in his report on the border said that existing technology could deal with the issue. And it's unbelievable. It's part of the problem that I referred to earlier, that our own politicians, our own civil service didn't hold them to their word. Instead, they fell for it because actually it suited them. They wanted to create a problem because they want to keep the status quo. They don't want to improve things for the people.

Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our press conference and launch this morning. I just want to reiterate my thanks to the Penny family for hosting us, my thanks to all of you who've come to be with us this morning, my thanks to Nigel and the candidates, and please have a very safe trip home. Thank you very much.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999366998672485,0.0,0.0,0.0,Populist

Helping young people buy their own home.
Getting the long-term unemployed back to work.
Freezing fuel duty.
Backing marriage.
Cutting the deficit.
Creating jobs.
Creating wealth.
Make no mistake: it is this Party with the verve, energy and ideas to take our country forward.
And I want to thank everyone here for the great week we've had.
When we came to office, we faced a clear and daunting task: to turn our country around.
In May 2010, the needle on the gauge was at crisis point.
People were talking about this country in a way they had not done for decades.
But three and a half years later, we are beginning to turn the corner.
The deficit is falling.
Our economy is growing.
The numbers of our fellow countrymen and women in work are rising.
We are not there yet, not by a long way.
But, my friends, we are on our way.
I want to thank the people who have done the most to get us this far.
You. The British people.
Never giving up. Working those extra hours. Coping with those necessary cuts.
You. British business. You kept people on in the hard times. Invested before you knew for certain that things were getting better.
Together - we are clearing up the mess that Labour left.
But I have a simple question, to the people in this hall and beyond it.
Is that enough?
Is it enough that we just clear up Labour's mess and think 'job done'?
Is it enough to just fix what went wrong?
I say - no. Not for me.
This isn't job done; it is job begun.
I didn't come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right.
We in this party - we don't dream of deficits and decimal points and dry fiscal plans.
Our dreams are about helping people get on in life.
Aspiration, opportunity: these are our words, our dreams.
So today I want to talk about our one, abiding mission.
I believe it is the great Conservative mission.
That as our economy starts to recover, we build a land of opportunity in our country today.
Now, I know, it'll be tough.
But I know we've got what it takes in this Party.
Some people say ""can't be done"" - Conservatives say ""what's to stop us?""
They said we couldn't get terrorists out of our own country.
Well - Theresa knew otherwise......and that's why Abu Qatada had his very own May Day this year...
Didn't it feel good seeing him get on that plane?
Some people said the NHS wasn't safe in our hands.
Well - we knew otherwise.
Who protected spending on the NHS? Not Labour - us.
Who started the Cancer Drugs Fund? Not Labour - us.
And by the way - who presided over Mid Staffs?
Patients left for so long without water, they were drinking out of dirty vases......people's grandparents lying filthy and unwashed for days.
Who allowed that to happen? Yes, it was Labour......and don't you dare lecture anyone on the NHS again.
And some people say a lot of things on Europe.
You'll never be able to veto an EU treaty.
You'll never cut the Budget.
And if you did these things - you'd have no allies in Europe.
Well we've proved them wrong.
I vetoed that treaty.
I got Britain out of the EU bail-out scheme.
And yes - I cut that budget.
And in doing all this, we haven't lost respect - we've won allies to get powers back from Europe.
That is what we will do......and at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum.
That is our pledge. It will be your choice: in or out.
BRITAIN IN THE WORLD
And friends, you know what someone said about us recently?
Apparently some Russian official said: Britain is ""just a small island that no-one pays any attention to.""
Really?
Let me just get this off my chest.
When the world wanted rights, who wrote Magna Carta?
When they wanted representation, who built the first Parliament?
When they looked for compassion, who led the abolition of slavery?
When they searched for equality, who gave women the vote?
When their freedom was in peril, who offered blood, toil, tears and sweat?
And today - whose music do they dance to?
Whose universities do they flock to?
Whose football league do they watch?
Whose example of tolerance of people living together from every nation, every religion, young and old, straight and gay?
Whose example do they aspire to?
I haven't even got on to the fact that this small island beat Russia in the Olympics last year, or that the biggest-selling vodka brand in the world isn't Russian, it's British - Smirnoff - made in Fife....so yes, we may be a small island
but I tell you what, we're a great country.
But I want to make a serious point about our place in the world.
Following that vote on Syria in the House of Commons, some people said it was time for Britain to re-think our role.
I'm sorry - but I don't agree.
If we shrunk from the world we would be less safe and less prosperous.
The role we play, the organisations we belong to...... and yes - the fact our defence budget remains the 4th largest in the world......all this is not about national vanity - it's about our national interest.
When British citizens -our fathers, mothers, daughters- are in danger......whether that's in the deserts of Algeria or the city of Nairobi
then combatting international terrorism - it matters to us.
When five of the world's fastest growing economies are African,
then trading with Africa - and yes helping Africa to develop with aid - that matters to us.
And at the heart of all this work - the finest Foreign Secretary I could ask for: William Hague.
Around the world, we really do matter as a United Kingdom:
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
The date of the referendum has been set. The decision is for Scotland to make.
All the arguments about our economy, jobs, currency - I believe they make an unanswerable case for the UK.
But today I want a more simple message to go out to all the people of Scotland.
From us here in this hall, from me, from this party, from this country, from England, Wales, Northern Ireland
and it's this:
We want you to stay.
We want to stick together.
Think of all we've achieved together - the things we can do together.
The nations - as one.
Our Kingdom - United.
For 12 years now, men and women from all parts of these islands have been serving their country in Afghanistan.
Next year, the last of our combat troops will be coming home......having trained up the Afghans to look after their own country.
More than a decade of war.
Sacrifice beyond measure - from the finest and bravest armed forces in the world.
And I want us to stand, to raise the roof in here, to show just how proud of those men and women we are.
THATCHER
We in this room are a team.
And this year, we said goodbye to one of our team.
Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad.
Rescuing our economy. Giving power to our people. Spreading home ownership. Creating work. Winning the Cold War. Saving the Falklands.
I asked her about her record once.
I was sitting next to her at a dinner - and I was really nervous.
As ever she was totally charming, she put me at ease......but after a while I said: ""Margaret, if you had your time in Government again, is there anything you'd do differently?""
And she turned to me and said: ""You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around.""
Well we can all agree with that - and we can all agree on this......she was the greatest peace-time Prime Minister our country has ever had.
LABOUR'S MESS
Margaret Thatcher had an almighty mess to clear up when she came to office
and so did we.
We will never forget what we found.
The biggest Budget deficit in our peace-time history.
The deepest recession since the Second World War.
But it wasn't just the debt and deficit Labour left,
it was who got hurt.
Millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare.
The richest paying lower tax rates than their cleaners.
Unsustainable, debt-fuelled banks booming - while manufacturing withered away.
The North falling further behind.
Towns where a quarter of people lived on benefits.
Schools where 8 out of 10 children didn't get five decent GCSEs.
Yes, they were famously ""intensely relaxed"" about people getting filthy rich....but tragically, they were also ""intensely relaxed"" about people staying stuck on welfare year after year...
""intensely relaxed"" about children leaving school without proper qualifications so they couldn't hope to get a job at the end of it.
That was it.
That was what they left.
The casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system...
a country for the few built by the so-called party of the many.
and Labour: we will never let you forget it.
OUR MISSION
These past few years have been a real struggle.
But what people want to know now is: was the struggle worth it?
And here's the honest answer.
The struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we've started.
Finishing the job means understanding this.
Our economy may be turning the corner - and of course that's great.
But we still haven't finished paying for Labour's Debt Crisis.
If anyone thinks that's over, done, dealt with - they're living in a fantasy land.
This country's debt crisis, created by Labour, is not over.
After three years of cuts, we still have one of the biggest deficits in the world.
We are still spending more than we earn.
We still need to earn more and yes, our Government still needs to spend less.
I see that Labour have stopped talking about the debt crisis and now they talk about the cost of living crisis.
As if one wasn't directly related to the other.
If you want to know what happens if you don't deal with a debt crisis.....and how it affects the cost of living......just go and ask the Greeks.
So finishing the job means sticking to our course until we've paid off all of Labour's deficit, not just some of it.
And yes - let's run a surplus so that this time we fix the roof when the sun is shining......as George said in that brilliant speech on Monday.
To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away all the progress we've made.
It would put us back to square one.
Unbelievably, that's exactly what Labour now want to do.
How did they get us into this mess?
Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt.
And what did they propose last week?
More spending, more borrowing, more debt.
They have learned nothing - literally nothing - from the crisis they created.
But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left.
It means building something better in its place.
In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on.
In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off.
In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed.
Our economy, our society, welfare, schools....all reformed, all rebuilt - with one aim, one mission in mind:
To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all.
For all.
So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you're black or you're white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were....what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you'll have the chance to make it.
That's what the land of opportunity means.
That's what finishing the job means.
Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things.
But wishing for something, caring about something - that's not enough.
You can't conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister's pen.
It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and - above all - the right values.
When the left say: you can't expect too much from the poorest kids; don't ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution.
Here in this party we say: that's just wrong.
If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them.
Yes, you must help people - but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts.
You don't help children succeed by dumbing down education....you help them by pushing them hard.
Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.
You don't help people by leaving them stuck on welfare....but by helping them stand on their own two feet.
Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work - and the dignity that brings
We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise......these are not dirty, elitist words - they're not the problem......they really are the solution because it's not government that creates jobs, it's businesses.
it's businesses that get wages in people's pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country.
There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity. No quick fix. No easy way to do it.
You build it business by business, school by school, person by person....patiently, practically, painstakingly.
And underpinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.
This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state.
It's how we've been clearing up the mess.
And it's how we're going to build something better in its place.
So let's stick with it and finish the job we've started.
ECONOMY
A land of opportunity starts in our economy.
The chance to get a decent job. To start a business. To own a home.
And at the end of it all - more money in your pocket.
To get decent jobs for people, you've got to recognise some fundamental economic facts.
We are in a global race today. No one owes us a living.
Last week, our ambition to compete in the global race was airily dismissed as a race to the bottom......that it means competing with China on sweatshops and India on low wages.
No - those countries are becoming our customers.
and we've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology.
And here's something else you need to recognise about this race.
The plain fact is this.
All those global companies that employ lots of people - they can set up anywhere in the world.
They could go to Silicon Valley. To Berlin.
And yes, here in Manchester.
And these companies base their decisions on some simple things: like the tax rates in each country.
So if those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here.
And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs.
Do you get that, Labour?
British people don't get those jobs.
Last week Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers.
That is just about the most damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy you could possibly come up with.
I get to visit some amazing factories in my job.
One of my favourites is Jaguar Land Rover......not just because they actually let me get in a car and drive it around on my own......but really because I get to meet people there who are incredibly proud of their work and their craftsmanship......the fact that what they're making sells around the world - the best of British design and engineering.
So when Ed Miliband talks about the face of big business, I think about the faces of these hardworking people.
Labour is saying to their employers: ""we want to put up your taxes. don't come here - stick your jobs and take them elsewhere"".
I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience.
But it's crazy for our country.
So if Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business - ours is to back business.
Regulation - down. Taxes - cut for businesses large and small. A new industrial policy that looks to the future - green jobs, aerospace jobs, life science jobs.
We've made a good start: 1.4 million new jobs created in our private sector since we came to office......and that is 1.4 million reasons to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity, it's easier to start your own business.
To all those people who strike out on their own, who sit there night after night......checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up......I say I have so much respect for you - you are national heroes.
I'll never forget watching Samantha do just that - winning her first customer, sorting out the cash flow, that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed.
I was incredibly proud of her then - and I am incredibly proud of her now.
People setting up new businesses need finance - that's why we've brought in Start-up Loans.
They need their taxes cut - and we're doing it - up to £2000 off your National Insurance bill for every small business
And it's working.
Let me tell you how many businesses have started up in Britain since the election: over 300,000.
That is 300,000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity, more people must be able to own a home of their own.
You know that old saying, your home is your castle?
Well for most young people today, their home is their landlord's.
Generation Y is starting to become Generation Why Do We Bother?
Millions of them stuck renting when they're desperate to buy.
I met a couple on Sunday - Emily and James.
They'd both had decent jobs, but because they didn't have rich parents, they couldn't get a big enough deposit to buy a house.
And let me tell you where I met them.
In their new home, bought with our Help to Buy mortgage scheme.
It was still half built. but they showed me where the kitchen would be.
Outside there was rubble all over the ground, but they'd already bought a lawn-mower.
And they talked about how excited they were to be spending a first Christmas in a home of their own.
That is what we're about.
And this, the party of aspiration is going to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity there's another thing people need.
the most important thing of all.
more money in their pockets.
These have been difficult years.
People have found it hard to make ends meet.
That's why we've frozen council tax.
and why we are freezing fuel duty.
But we need to do more. I know that.
We've heard Labour's ideas to help with the cost of living.
Taxes on banks they want to spend ten times over.
Promising free childcare - then saying that actually, you've got to pay for it.
An energy promise they admitted 24 hours later they might not be able to keep.
It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes... cobbled together for the TV cameras.
Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy.
To raise living standards in the long-term, you need to do some major things:......you need to cut the deficit to keep mortgage rates low......you need to grow your economy, get people jobs......and yes - cut people's taxes.
I want people to keep more of their money.
We've already cut the taxes of 25 million hardworking people......and yes - that is 25 million more reasons to finish the job we've started.
We're Tories. We believe in low taxes. And believe me - we will keep on cutting the taxes of hardworking people.
NORTH SOUTH
And here in Manchester let me say this: when I say a land of opportunity for all I mean everyone - North and South.
This country has been too London-centric for far too long.
That's why we need a new North-South railway line.
The fact is this.
The West Coast mainline is almost full.
We have to build a new railway.
and the choice is between another old-style Victorian one - or a high speed one.
Just imagine if someone had said, no, we can't build the M1, or the Severn Bridge, imagine how that would be hobbling our economy today.
HS2 is about bringing North and South together in our national endeavour.
Because think of what more we could do with the pistons firing in all parts of our country.
With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy.
With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry.
With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials.
We're building an economy for the North and South, embracing new technologies, producing things and selling them to the world.
So make no mistake who's looking forward in British politics......we'll leave the 1970s-style socialism to others......we are the party of the future.
We're making progress.
You know how I know that?
It's every week, at Prime Minister's Questions.
There was a time when I'd look across to Ed Balls, and there he was, shouting his head off, and doing this with his hands - screaming out the economy was flat-lining..and all with such glee.
But recently, it's gone a bit quiet.
Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy's now growing?
Well, I've got a gesture of my own for Ed Balls....and don't worry - it's not a rude one....jobs are up..construction is up....manufacturing is up....inward investment..retail sales..homebuilding....business confidence..consumer confidence - all these things are up.
And to anyone who wants to talk our economy down, let me tell you this.
Since this conference began, over 100,000 jet planes have soared into the sky on wings made in Britain.
Every single day in this country, over 4,000 cars are coming off the production line - ready to be exported around the globe.
Last year, Britain overtook France as Germany's top trading partner......not bad for a nation of shop-keepers.
And that's the point.
Exports to China are up.
Exports to Brazil are up..exports to India, Russia, Thailand, South Korea, Australia - all up.
So let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics...
Yes - the oceans can rise..and empires can fall..but one thing will never, ever change..it's Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up.
EDUCATION
A land of opportunity means educating our children - and I mean all our children.
It's OK for the children who have parents reading them stories every night - and that's great..but what about the ones at the back of the class, in the chaotic home, in the home of the drug addict or alcoholic?
We need these children - and frankly they need us.
That's why three and a half years ago, one man came into the Department of Education....Michael Gove, there he is......with a belief in excellence and massive energy......like a cross between Mr Chips and the Duracell bunny.
Let's look at the results.
More students studying proper science.
More children learning a foreign language.
We've ended the dumbing down in exams.
For the first time - children in our schools will learn the new language of computer coding.
And we're sending a clear message to children: if you fail English and maths GCSE, you're going to have to take and re-take them again until you pass.
Because as I tell my own children - there's not a job in the world where you don't need to spell and add up properly.
But ultimately - really raising standards means innovation, choice..it means giving passionate people the freedom to run our schools.
That's what Free Schools are all about.
I'll never forget sitting in the classroom at Perry Beeches III in Birmingham, on the first day of term this year.
I met a mum there who said to me - this is what I've dreamed of for my child......proper uniforms, high standards......this is going to give my child a good start in life.
When Michael Howard asked me what job I wanted in the Shadow cabinet I said education......because this is the kind of thing I came into politics to bring about.
You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools?
Labour's official policy is to be against them......but - get this - Labour MPs are backing them in their local area.
And not just any Labour MPs.
I promise I'm not making this up.....the Shadow Education Secretary - Stephen Twigg - has backed one in his own city.
Unbelievable.
And isn't that always the way with the Left?
They don't like privilege - unless of course it's for their own children.
Well we in this Party are ambitious for all our children......and we've got to finish the job we started.
We've already got technical colleges run by great companies like JCB......I say: let's have one of those colleges in every single major town.
We've had a million apprenticeships start with this Government......now we want a new expectation: as you leave school you have a choice - go to university or do an apprenticeship.
And while we've still got children leaving primary school not reading, writing and adding up properly......let us set this ambition for our country: let's eliminate illiteracy and give every one of those children a chance.
And friends as we do all this, we're remembering the most vulnerable children of all.
There are thousands of children every year who grow up in homes where nappies - and bedclothes - go unchanged......and where their cries of pain go unheard.
These children just need the most basic opportunity of all: a loving family.
Two years ago I told you about our determination to speed up adoption......and this past year, we saw record numbers finding permanent, loving homes.
4000 children adopted......that is 4000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.
And as we keep on with this, we remember who is on the front line.
I have to make some tough decisions in my job......but none as tough as whether to break up a family and rescue a child... or try and stitch that family back together.
Social work is a noble and vital calling.
I'll never forget how after my son Ivan was born, a social worker sat patiently in our kitchen and told us about the sort of help we might need.
This Government has helped get some of the brightest graduates into teaching......and we have pledged to do the same for social work......now let us, in this hall, hear it for Britain's social workers who are doing such an important job in our country today.
WELFARE
The land of opportunity needs one final thing: welfare that works.
We know how badly things went wrong.
Our fellow citizens working every hour of every day to put food on the table ask this: why should my taxes go to people who could work but don't?
Or to those who live in homes that hardworking people could never afford?
Or to people who have no right to be here in the first place?
I say this to the British people: you have every right to be angry about a system that is unfair and unjust - and that's why we are sorting it out.
We've capped welfare. We've capped housing benefit. We've insisted on new rules so that if you reject work, you lose benefits.
And let's be absolutely clear.
As Boris said in that great speech yesterday, the problems in our welfare system and the problems in our immigration system are inextricably linked.
If we don't get our people back to work - we shouldn't be surprised if millions want to come here to work.
But we must act on immigration directly too - and we are.
Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges.
And when the Immigration Bill comes before Parliament, we will make sure some simple and fair things, that should have always been the case, are now set in stone.
If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it.
If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house. Not off the council, not off anyone else.
When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills.
If you appeal - you must do it from your own country, after you've been deported, not from here.
And on these huge, national problems we are making progress.
Immigration has come down.
On welfare: not only are there more people in work than ever before..the number of households where no one works is at its lowest rate since records began..and I want to thank the most determined champion for social justice this Party has ever had: Iain Duncan Smith.
Iain understands that this isn't about fixing systems, it's about saving lives..and that's why we've got to finish the job we've started.
There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training.
Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits.
It's time for bold action here.
We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all.
Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice:
Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job.
But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that.
And let no one paint ideas like this as callous.
Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?
No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way. and so must we.
So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning.
And you know - on this, as on everything else, Labour will fight us....but remember: we are giving people real opportunities.
I've had people say to me ""I'm back on my feet""... ""I feel worthwhile.""
One wrote to me saying: now I can tell my son his Dad really does something.
This is what our Party is all about.
We don't patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head.
We look people in the eye as equals and say: yes, you've been down - but you're not out..you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance.
And that's why we can say today that it's this Party that is fighting for all those who were written off by Labour....it's this Party that's for the many not the few..Yes - the land of despair was Labour....but the land of hope is Tory.
We have done some big things to transform Britain.
But we need to finish the job we've started.
We need to go further, do more for hardworking people......give more children a chance, back more businesses, help create more jobs.
And I'm clear about how that job will best get done.
It requires a strong Government, with a clear mandate, that is accountable for what it promises and yes, what it delivers.
And let me tell everyone here what that means.
When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition......we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative Government - because that is what our country needs.
CONCLUSION
You don't do this job to be popular.
You do it because you love your country.
I do the best I can. And for me, it comes back to some simple things.
Country first. Do what's decent. Think long-term.
There's an old story that's told about a great hall in Oxford, near my constituency.
For hundreds of years it's stood there - held up with vast oak beams.
In the 19th century, those beams needed replacing.
And you know what they found?
500 years before, someone had thought. those beams will need replacing one day..so they planted some oak trees.
Just think about that.
Centuries had passed. Columbus had reached America. Gravity had been discovered..and when those oaks were needed, they were ready.
Margaret Thatcher once said: ""We are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all.""
That is what we are doing today.
Not just making do and mending..but making something better.
Since I got to my feet, almost a hundred children have been born across this country.
Children of wealth - and children of none.
Children of parents in work - and children of parents out of work.
For every single one of those new-born babies let us pledge today that we will build something better..a land of opportunity.
A country built on that enduring principle, seared in our hearts, that if you work hard, save, play by the rules and do your fair share - then nothing should stand in your way.
A new economy.
A new welfare system.
A new set of values in our schools.
Not just fixing the mess we inherited - but building something better.
We've got a year and a half 'til that election....a year and a half until Britain makes a choice: move forward to something better or go back to something worse..but I believe that if this party fights with all we have, then this country will make the right choice.
Because we always have before.
Whenever we've had the choice of giving in to some shabby compromise or pushing forward to something better we've said: this is Great Britain..the improbable hero of history..the country that doesn't give in, that doesn't give up..that knows there's no such thing as destiny - only our determination to succeed.
So I look to our future and I'm confident.
There are battles to fight but beyond this hall are the millions of hardworking people who renew the great in Great Britain every day..in the way they work and the way they give and raise their families.
These are the people we have alongside us....together we've made it this far......together we'll finish the job we've started....together we'll build that land of opportunity.",0.0,0.0,0.9999041557312012,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

They will, as usual, weigh up the arguments, reflect on them quietly, discuss them with friends and family, and then, calmly and without fuss, take their decision.
But this time, their decision will not be for a Parliament, or even two.
They will decide the destiny of our country, not for 5 years or for 10, but in all probability for decades, perhaps a lifetime.
This is a decision that is bigger than any individual politician or government.
It will have real, permanent and direct consequences for this country and every person living in it.
Should we continue to forge our future as a proud, independent nation while remaining a member of the European Union, as we have been for the last 43 years? Or should we abandon it?
Let me say at the outset that I understand why many people are wrestling with this decision, and why some people's heads and hearts are torn.
And I understand and respect the views of those who think we should leave, even if I believe they are wrong and that leaving would inflict real damage on our country, its economy and its power in the world.
I believe that, despite its faults and its frustrations, the United Kingdom is stronger, safer and better off by remaining a member of the European Union. Better off? Certainly.
We are part of a single market of 500 million people which Britain helped to create. Our goods and, crucially, our services - which account for almost 80% of our economy - can trade freely by right. We help decide the rules. The advantages of this far outweigh any disadvantages.
Our membership of the single market is one of the reasons why our economy is doing so well, why we have created almost 2.4 million jobs over the last 6 years, and why so many companies from overseas - from China or India, the United States, Australia and other Commonwealth countries invest so much in the UK.
It is one of the factors - together with our superb workforce, the low taxes set by the British government, and our climate of enterprise - which makes Britain such an excellent place to do business.
All this is alongside - let us note - our attractive regulatory environment. According to the OECD, it is second only to the Netherlands, itself an EU member - giving the lie to those who claim that the British economy is being strangled by regulation from Brussels.
If we leave, the only certainty we will have is uncertainty.
The Treasury has calculated that the cost to every household in Britain would be as high as £4,300 by 2030 if we leave. £4,300.
The overwhelming weight of independent opinion - from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD, from the London School of Economics to the Institute for Fiscal Studies - also supports the fact that Britain will suffer an immediate economic shock, and then be permanently poorer for the long-term.
The evidence is clear: we will be better off in, and poorer if we leave.
As Charles Dunstone, the founder of Carphone Warehouse, an entrepreneur not averse to risk, has said: ""In my experience there are calculated risks, there are clever risks, and there are unnecessary and dangerous risks. And from all I can conclude, Brexit sits firmly in the latter camp.""
So the onus is on those who advocate leaving to prove that Britain will be better off outside the EU. Those advocating Brexit have spent many years preparing for this moment. And yet they seem unable to set out a clear, comprehensive plan for our future outside the EU.
Some admit there would be a severe economic shock, but assert nonchalantly that it would be 'a price worth paying'.
Others are in denial that there would be a shock at all. And they can't agree what their plan for post-Brexit Britain would look like.
One minute we are urged to follow Norway, the next minute Canada. A few days later Switzerland offers the path forward, until it becomes clear that their arrangement doesn't provide much access for services to the EU's single market - and services, as I've said, are almost 4 fifths of the British economy.
Most recently, the Leavers have noticed that a number of European countries that sit outside of the EU have negotiated separate trade arrangements with the EU.
They called this collection of countries the 'European free trade zone'.
But in fact, this doesn't exist: it is a patchwork of different arrangements, all of them far inferior to what we have now.
They have gone on to suggest that Britain might join this non-existent zone, just like Albania.
Seriously? Even the Albanian Prime Minister thought that idea was a joke.
The Leave campaign are asking us to take a massive risk with the future of our economy and the future of our country.
And yet they can't even answer the most basic questions.
What would Britain's relationship be with the EU if we were to leave? Will we have a free trade agreement, or will we fall back on World Trade Organisation rules?
The man who headed the WTO for 8 years thinks this would be and I quote ""a terrible replacement for access to the EU single market.""
Some of them say we would keep full access to the EU single market.
If so, we would have to accept freedom of movement, a contribution to the EU budget, and accept all EU rules while surrendering any say over them.
In which case, we would have given up sovereignty rather than taken it back.
Others say we would definitely leave the single market - including, yesterday, the Vote Leave campaign - despite the critical importance of the single market to jobs and investment in our country.
I can only describe this as a reckless and irresponsible course. These are people's jobs and livelihoods that are being toyed with.
And the Leave campaign have no answers to the most basic questions.
What access would we try to secure back into the single market from the outside? How long would it take to negotiate a new relationship with the EU? What would happen to the 53 trade deals we have with other markets around the world through the EU?
The Leave campaign can't answer them because they don't know the answers. They have no plan.
And yet sceptical voters who politely ask for answers are denounced for their lack of faith in Britain, or met with sweeping assurances that the world will simply jump to our tune.
If you were buying a house or a car, you wouldn't do it without insisting on seeing what was being offered, and making sure it wasn't going to fall apart the moment you took possession of it.
So why would you do so when the future of your entire country is at stake?
The British people will keep asking these questions every day between now and 23 June, and demanding some answers.
Nothing is more important than the strength of our economy.
Upon it depends the jobs and livelihoods of our people, and also the strength and security of our nation.
If we stay, we know what we get - continued full access to a growing single market, including in energy, services and digital, together with the benefit of the huge trade deals in prospect between the EU and the United States and other large markets.
If we leave, it is - genuinely - a leap in the dark.
But my main focus today will not be on the economic reasons to remain in the EU, important though they are.
I want to concentrate instead on what our membership means for our strength and security in the world, and the safety of our people, and to explain why, again, I believe the balance of advantage comes down firmly in favour of staying rather than leaving.
Because this decision is a decision about our place in the world, about how we keep our country safe, about how Britain can get things done - in Europe and across the world - and not just accept a world dictated by others.
So today I want to set out the big, bold patriotic case for Britain to remain a member of the EU.
I want to show that if you love this country, if you want to keep it strong in the world, and keep our people safe, our membership of the EU is one of the tools - one of the tools - that helps us to do these things, like our membership of other international bodies such as NATO or the UN Security Council.
Let us accept that for all our differences, one thing unites both sides in this referendum campaign.
We love this country, and we want the best future for it. Ours is a great country.
Not just a great country in the history books, although it surely is that.
But a great country right now, with the promise of becoming even greater tomorrow.
We're the fifth largest economy in the world. Europe's foremost military power. Our capital city is a global icon. Our national language the world's language.
Our national flag is worn on clothing and t-shirts the world over - not only as a fashion statement, but as a symbol of hope and a beacon for liberal values all around the world.
People from all 4 corners of the earth watch our films, dance to our music, flock to our galleries and theatres, cheer on our football teams and cherish our institutions.
These days, even our food is admired the world over.
Our national broadcaster is one of the most recognised brands on the planet, and our monarch is one of the most respected people in the world.
Britain today is a proud, successful, thriving nation, a nation the world admires and looks up to, and whose best days lie ahead of it.
We are the product of our long history - of the decision of our forebears, of the heroism of our parents and grandparents.
And yet we are a country that also has our eyes fixed firmly on the future - that is a pioneer in the modern world: from the birth of the internet to the decoding of the genome.
If there is one constant in the ebb and flow of our island story, it is the character of the British people.
Our geography has shaped us, and shapes us today. We are special, different, unique.
We have the character of an island nation which has not been invaded for almost a thousand years, and which has built institutions which have endured for centuries.
As a people we are ambitious, resilient, independent-minded. And, I might add, tolerant, generous, and inventive.
But above all we are obstinately practical, rigorously down to earth, natural debunkers.
We approach issues with a cast of mind rooted in common sense. We are rightly suspicious of ideology, and sceptical of grand schemes and grandiose promises.
So we have always seen the European Union as a means to an end - the way to boost our prosperity and help anchor peace and stability across the European continent - but we don't see it as an end in itself.
We insistently ask: why? How?
And as we weigh up the competing arguments in this referendum campaign, we must apply that practical rigour which is the hallmark of being British.
Would going it alone make Britain more powerful in the world? Would we be better able to get our way, or less able?
Would going it alone make us more secure from terrorism, or would it be better to remain and cooperate closely with our neighbours?
Would going it alone really give us more control over our affairs, or would we soon find that actually we had less, and that we had given up a secure future for one beset by years of uncertainty and trouble with no way back?
Would going it alone open up new opportunities, or would it in fact close them down and narrow our options?
That is certainly the approach I have taken to judging whether Britain is stronger and safer inside the European Union or leaving it.
And I have just one yardstick: how do we best advance our national interest?
Keeping our people safe at home and abroad, and moulding the world in the way that we want - more peaceful, more stable, more free, with the arteries of commerce and trade flowing freely.
That is our national interest in a nutshell - and it's the question that has confronted every British prime minister since the office was created: how do we best advance Britain's interests in the circumstances of the day?
If my experience as Prime Minister had taught me that our membership of the EU was holding Britain back or undermining our global influence, I would not hesitate to recommend that we should leave.
But my experience is the opposite.
The reason that I want Britain to stay in a reformed EU is in part because of my experience over the last 6 years is that it does help make our country better off, safer and stronger.
And there are 4 reasons why this is the case.
First, what happens in Europe affects us, whether we like it or not, so we must be strong in Europe if we want to be strong at home and in the world.
Second, the dangerous international situation facing Britain today, means that the closest possible cooperation with our European neighbours isn't an optional extra - it is essential. We need to stand united. Now is a time for strength in numbers.
Third, keeping our people safe from modern terrorist networks like Daesh and from serious crime that increasingly crosses borders means that we simply have to develop much closer means of security cooperation between countries within Europe. Britain needs to be fully engaged with that.
Fourth, far from Britain's influence in the world being undermined by our membership of the EU, it amplifies our power, like our membership of the UN or of NATO. It helps us achieve the things we want - whether it is fighting Ebola in Africa, tackling climate change, taking on the people smugglers. That's not just our view; it's the view of our friends and allies, too.
Let me go through them in turn.
First: Europe is our immediate neighbourhood, and what happens on the continent affects us profoundly, whether we like it or not.
Our history teaches us: the stronger we are in our neighbourhood, the stronger we are in the world.
For 2,000 years, our affairs have been intertwined with the affairs of Europe. For good or ill, we have written Europe's history just as Europe has helped to write ours.
From Caesar's legions to the wars of the Spanish Succession, from the Napoleonic Wars to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Proud as we are of our global reach and our global connections, Britain has always been a European power, and we always will be.
We know that to be a global power and to be a European power are not mutually exclusive.
And the moments of which we are rightly most proud in our national story include pivotal moments in European history.
Blenheim. Trafalgar. Waterloo. Our country's heroism in the Great War.
And most of all our lone stand in 1940, when Britain stood as a bulwark against a new dark age of tyranny and oppression.
When I sit in the Cabinet Room, I never forget the decisions that were taken in that room in those darkest of times.
When I fly to European summits in Brussels from RAF Northolt, I pass a Spitfire just outside the airfield, a vital base for brave RAF and Polish pilots during the Battle of Britain.
I think of the Few who saved this country in its hour of mortal danger, and who made it possible for us to go on and help liberate Europe.
Like any Brit, my heart swells with pride at the sight of that aircraft, or whenever I hear the tell-tale roar of those Merlin engines over our skies in the summer.
Defiant, brave, indefatigable.
But it wasn't through choice that Britain was alone. Churchill never wanted that. Indeed he spent the months before the Battle of Britain trying to keep our French allies in the war, and then after France fell, he spent the next 18 months persuading the United States to come to our aid.
And in the post-war period he argued passionately for Western Europe to come together, to promote free trade, and to build institutions which would endure so that our continent would never again see such bloodshed.
Isolationism has never served this country well. Whenever we turn our back on Europe, sooner or later we come to regret it.
We have always had to go back in, and always at a much higher cost.
The serried rows of white headstones in lovingly-tended Commonwealth war cemeteries stand as silent testament to the price that this country has paid to help restore peace and order in Europe.
Can we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking?
I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.
It's barely been 20 years since war in the Balkans and genocide on our continent in Srebrenica. In the last few years, we have seen tanks rolling into Georgia and Ukraine. And of this I am completely sure.
The European Union has helped reconcile countries which were once at each others' throats for decades. Britain has a fundamental national interest in maintaining common purpose in Europe to avoid future conflict between European countries.
And that requires British leadership, and for Britain to remain a member. The truth is this: what happens in our neighbourhood matters to Britain.
That was true in 1914, in 1940 and in 1989. Or, you could add 1588, 1704 and 1815. And it is just as true in 2016.
Either we influence Europe, or it influences us.
And if things go wrong in Europe, let's not pretend we can be immune from the consequences.
Second, the international situation confronting Britain today means that the closest possible cooperation with our European neighbours isn't an optional extra.
It is essential for this country's security and our ability to get things done in the world.
We see a newly belligerent Russia. The rise of the Daesh network to our east and to our south. The migration crisis. Dealing with these requires unity of purpose in the west.
Sometimes you hear the Leave campaign talk about these issues as if they are - in and of themselves - reasons to leave the EU.
But we can't change the continent to which we are attached. We can't tow our island to a more congenial part of the world.
The threats affect us whether we're in the EU or not, and Britain washing its hands of helping to deal with them will only make the problems worse.
Within Europe they require a shared approach by the European democracies, more than at any time since the height of the Cold War.
It is true, of course, that it is to NATO and to the Transatlantic Alliance that we look to for our defence.
The principle enshrined in the North Atlantic Treaty - that an attack on one is an attack on all - that remains the cornerstone of our national defence.
That fundamental sharing of national sovereignty in order to deter potential aggressors. That is as valid today as it was when NATO was founded in 1949.
It is an example of how real control is more important than the theory of sovereignty.
The European Union - and the close culture of intergovernmental cooperation between governments which it embodies - is a vital tool in our armoury to deal with these threats.
That is why NATO and top military opinion - British, American, European - is clear that the common purpose of the EU does not undermine NATO, it is a vital reinforcement to it.
And they are equally crystal clear: Britain's departure would weaken solidarity and the unity of the west as a whole.
Now some of those who wish us to leave the EU openly say that they hope the entire organisation will unravel as a result.
I find this extraordinary.
How could it possibly be in our interests to risk the clock being turned back to an age of competing nationalisms in Europe?
And for Britain, of all countries, to be responsible for triggering such a collapse would be an act of supreme irresponsibility, entirely out of character for us as a nation.
Others suggest that Britain stalking out could lead to and I quote ""the democratic liberation of an entire continent"".
Well, tell that to the Poles, the Czechs, the Baltic States and the other countries of central and eastern Europe which languished for so long behind the Iron Curtain.
They cherish their liberty and their democracy. They see Britain as the country that did more than any other to unlock their shackles and enable them to take their rightful place in the family of European nations.
And frankly they view the prospect of Britain leaving the EU with utter dismay. They watch what is happening in Moscow with alarm and trepidation.
Now is a time for strength in numbers. Now is the worst possible time for Britain to put that at risk. Only our adversaries will benefit.
Now third, the evolving threats to our security and the rise of the Daesh network mean that we have to change the way we work to keep our people safe. Security today is not only a matter of hard defence, of stopping tanks - it is also about rooting out terrorist networks, just as it is about detecting illegal immigrants, stopping human trafficking and organised crime. And that makes much closer security cooperation between our European nations essential.
I have no greater responsibility than the safety of the people of this country, and keeping us safe from the terrorist threat.
As the Home Secretary said in her speech a fortnight ago: being in the EU helps to makes us safer.
We shouldn't put ourselves at risk by leaving.
One of her predecessors, Charles Clarke, reiterated that only this morning.
And the message of Jonathan Evans and John Sawers, former heads of MI5 and MI6 respectively, is absolutely unmistakable: Britain is safer inside the European Union.
During the last 6 years, the terrorist threat against this country has grown.
Our threat level is now at 'Severe', which means that an attack is 'highly likely'. Indeed such an attack could happen at any time.
But the threat has not only grown, it has changed in its nature.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels are a reminder that we face this threat together - and we will only succeed in overcoming it by working much more closely together.
These terrorists operate throughout Europe; their networks use technology to spread their poison and to organise beyond geographical limits.
People say that to keep our defences up, you need a border. And they're right.
That's why we kept our borders, and we can check any passport - including for EU nationals - and we retain control over who we allow into our country.
But against the modern threat, having a border isn't enough. You also need information, you need data, you need intelligence. You need to cooperate with others to create mechanisms for sharing this information.
And, just as the Home Secretary said a fortnight ago, I can tell you this: whether it's working together to share intelligence on suspected terrorists; whether it's strengthening aviation security; addressing the challenge of cybercrime; preventing cross-border trade in firearms; tackling the migration crisis; or enhancing our own border security, the EU is not some peripheral institution, or a hindrance we have to work around - it is now an absolutely central part of how Britain can get things done.
Not by creating a vast new EU bureaucracy. Nor by sucking away the role and capabilities of our own world beating intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
But because their superb work depends on much closer cooperation between European governments and much faster and more determined action across Europe to deal with this new threat.
As the historian Niall Ferguson observed, it takes a network to defeat a network.
And European measures are a key weapon.
The European Arrest Warrant allows us to bring criminals and terrorists, like one of the failed 21/7 Tube bombers who had fled to Italy, we can bring them back to the UK to face justice straight away.
Our membership of Europol gives us access to important databases that help us to identify criminals.
And we have begun to cooperate on DNA and fingerprint matching across borders, too. These tools help us in real-time, life-or-death situations.
One of the Paris attackers, Salah Abdeslam, was only identified quickly after the attack because the French police were able to use EU powers to exchange DNA and fingerprints with the Belgians.
Before this cooperation, DNA matching between 2 countries didn't take minutes, it could take over 4 months.
In the last few months alone, we have agreed a new Passenger Name Records directive, so that EU countries will have access to airline passenger data to enable us to identify those on terror watch-lists.
These new arrangements will also provide crucial details about how the tickets were bought, the bank accounts used and the people they are travelling with.
And the EU has recently switched on a new database, called SIS II, which is providing real-time alerts for suspected jihadists and other serious criminals.
Now I don't argue that if we left we would lose any ability to cooperate with our neighbours on a bilateral basis, or even potentially through some EU mechanisms.
But it is clear that leaving the EU will make cooperation more legally complex - and make our access to vital information much slower and more difficult.
Look at for instance Norway and Iceland: they began negotiating an extradition agreement with the EU in 2001 and yet today it is still not in force.
And of course we will miss out on the benefits of these new arrangements, and any that develop in future.
Now you can take the view that we don't need this cooperation - that we can just do without these extra capabilities.
That in my view is a totally complacent view. Especially in a world where the difference between a prevented attack and a successful attack can be just 1 missing piece of data; 1 piece of the jigsaw that the agencies found just too late.
You can also decide, as some on the Leave side seriously do, that even though working together is helpful for keeping us safe, it involves giving up too much sovereignty and ceding too much power over security cooperation to the European Court of Justice.
My view is this: when terrorists are planning to kill and maim people on British streets, the closest possible security cooperation is far more important than sovereignty in its purest theoretical form. I want to give our country real power, not the illusion of power.
Fourth, Britain's unique position and power in the world is not defined by our membership of the EU, any more than it is by our membership of the Commonwealth or the UN Security Council or the OECD or the IMF or the myriad other international organisations to which we belong.
But our EU membership, like our membership of other international organisations, magnifies our national power.
Britain is a global nation, with a global role and a global reach.
We take our own decisions, in our own interests. We always have done, we always will do.
In the years since we joined the EU, we have shown that time and again with British, national, sovereign decisions about our foreign and defence policy taken by British prime ministers and British ministers.
Liberating the Falkland Islands in a great feat of military endeavour. Freeing Kuwait from Iraq.
And, more recently, our mission to prevent Afghanistan continuing to be a safe haven for international terrorists.
As I speak here today, we are flying policing missions over the Baltic states. Training security forces in Nigeria. And of course, taking the fight to Daesh in Syria and Iraq.
So the idea that our membership of the EU has emasculated our power as a nation - this is complete nonsense.
Indeed, over the last 40 years, our global power has grown, not diminished.
In the years before we joined the EU, British governments presided over a steady retrenchment of our world role, borne of our economic weakness.
The decision to retreat East of Suez and abandon our aircraft carriers was taken in 1968.
Since then, starting with the transformation of our economy by Margaret Thatcher, we have turned around our fortunes.
In the 21st century, Britain is once again a country that is advancing, not retreating,
We have reversed the East of Suez policy, we are building permanent military bases in the Gulf, we are opening embassies all around the world, particularly in Asia.
We have a new strategic relationship with both China and India, have committed to spending 2% of our GDP on defence - 1 of only 5 NATO nations to be meeting that target.
Our expertise in aid, development and responding to crises is admired the world over.
We are renewing our independent nuclear deterrent.
Our 2 new aircraft carriers will be the biggest warships the Royal Navy has ever put to sea.
These are the actions of a proud, independent, self-confident, go-getting nation, a nation that is confident and optimistic about its future, not one cowed and shackled by its membership of the European Union.
On the contrary, our membership of the EU is one of the tools - just one - which we use, as we do our membership of NATO, or the Commonwealth, or the Five Power Defence Agreement with Australia, New Zealand and our allies in South East Asia, to amplify British power and to enhance our influence in the world.
Decisions on foreign policy are taken by unanimity. Britain has a veto.
So suggestions of an EU army are fanciful: national security is a national competence, and we would veto any suggestion of an EU army.
And as we sit in Britain's National Security Council, time and again I know that making Britain's actions count for far more means working with other countries in the EU.
Let me just take 3 specific examples of what I mean.
When Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, there was a real risk of a feeble European response, and of a split between the United States and Europe.
I convened a special meeting of the key European countries in Brussels, agreed a package of sanctions, and then drove that package through the full meeting of EU leaders - the European Council - later that same evening. I could not have done that outside the EU.
An example of Britain injecting steel into Europe's actions; delivering sanctions which have been far more effective because 28 countries are implementing them, not just the UK. And at the same time, we maintained that crucial unity between Europe and the US in the face of Russian aggression.
On Iran, again, it was Britain that pushed hardest for the implementation of an EU oil embargo against that country.
And it was the embargo which helped bring Iran to the negotiating table, and ultimately led to the UN sanctions that led to Iran abandoning its ambition to build a nuclear weapon. Who led those negotiations? It was the EU, with Britain playing a central role.
And on Ebola, it was Britain that used a European Council to push leaders into massively increasing Europe's financial contribution to tackling the disease in West Africa, thereby helping to contain and deal with what was a major public health emergency.
If Britain left the EU, we would lose that tool.
The German Chancellor would be there. The French President. The Italian Prime Minister. So would the Maltese, the Slovak, the Czech, the Polish, the Slovene, as well as all the others.
But Britain - the fifth largest economy in the world, the second biggest in Europe - would be absent, outside the room.
We would no longer take those decisions which have a direct bearing on Britain.
Instead we would have to establish an enormous diplomatic mission in Brussels to try and lobby participants before those meetings took place, and to try and then find out what had happened at them once they broke up.
Would we really be sitting around congratulating ourselves on how 'sovereign' we feel, without any control over events that affect us?
What an abject act of national retreat that would be for our great country, a diminution of Britain's power inflicted for the first time in our history not by economic woe or military defeat, but entirely of our own accord.
And when it comes to the strength of our United Kingdom, we should never forget that our strength is that of a voluntary union of 4 nations. So let me just say this about Scotland: you don't renew your country by taking a decision that could, ultimately, lead to its disintegration.
So as we weigh up this decision, let's do so with our eyes open.
And, of course, there is something closely connected to our power and influence that is absolutely vital: and that's the view of Britain's closest friends and allies.
Before you take any big decision in life, it's natural to consult those who wish you well, those who are with you in the tough times as well as in the good.
Sometimes they offer contradictory advice. Sometimes they don't have much of a view.
That's not the case here.
Our allies have a very clear view. They want us to remain members of the European Union.
Not only our fellow members of the EU - they want us to stay, and could be resentful if we chose to leave.
The Leave campaign keep telling us that there is a big world out there, if only we could lift our sights beyond Europe.
But the problem is they don't seem to hearing what that big world is saying.
There is our principal and indispensable ally, the guarantor of our security - the United States - whose President made the American position very plain, as only the oldest and best friends can.
And then there are the nations to which we are perhaps closest in the world, our cousins in Australia and New Zealand, whose prime ministers have spoken out so clearly.
The Secretary-General of NATO says that a weakened and divided Europe would be ""bad for security and bad for NATO"".
Only on Thursday, the Japanese Prime Minister - whose country is such a huge investor and employer in the United Kingdom - made very clear that Japan hoped the UK would decide to remain in the EU.
So too have big emerging economies like Indonesia.
And then there are our major new trading and strategic relationships - China and India - in whom some of the Leave campaign claim to invest such great hopes, at least when they're not saying they want to impose hefty tariffs on them. They too want us to remain in the EU.
So from America to Asia, from Australasia and the Indian sub-continent, our friends and our biggest trading partners, or potential trading partners, are telling us very clearly: it's your decision. But we hope you vote to stay in the European Union.
By the way, so too are our own Dependent Territories - Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands - with whom we have such a special bond and for whom we have a special responsibility.
And so? Next month we will make our choice as a nation.
I am very clear.
Britain is stronger and safer in the EU, as well as better off.
And the EU benefits from Britain being inside rather than out.
This is a Europe that Britain has helped to shape.
A continent that Britain helped liberate not once in the last century, but twice.
And we always wanted 2 things from the EU.
One: the creation of a vast single market; one we thought would benefit our economy enormously and spread prosperity throughout our neighbourhood.
And two: a Europe in which Britain helped the nations which languished under Communism return to the European fold; nations who still look to us as a friend and protector and do not want us to abandon them now.
We've got both of those things.
We did all that.
And imagine if we hadn't been there.
Who would have driven forward the single market?
Who would have prevented Europe from becoming a protectionist bloc?
Who would have stopped the EU from becoming a single currency zone?
Who would have stood up and said no to those pushing for political union?
Who would have done these things?
Because the truth is that if we were not in it, the European Union would in all likelihood still exist.
So we would still have to deal with it.
Now we have the opportunity to have what we have always wanted: to be in the single market, but out of the euro.
To be at the European Council, with our full voting and veto rights, but specifically exempted from ever closer union.
To have the opportunity to work, live and travel in other EU countries, but to retain full controls at our border.
To take part in the home affairs cooperation that benefits our security, but outside those measures we don't like.
And to keep our currency.
That is, frankly, the best of both worlds.
No wonder our friends and allies want us to take it. To lead, not to quit.
It is what the Chinese call a win win.
The Americans would probably say it's a slam dunk.
We are Britain.
No one seriously suggests any more that after 40 years in the EU, we have become less British.
We're proud. We're independent.
We get things done.
So let's not walk away from the institutions that help us to win in the world.
Let's not walk away from the EU, any more than we would walk away from the UN, or from NATO.
We're bigger than that.
So I say - instead, let us remain, let us fight our corner, let us play the part we should, as a great power in the world, and a great and growing power in Europe.
That is the big, bold, and patriotic decision for Britain on 23 June.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9999022483825684,0.0,Mainstream
UK_MST_03,UK,Mainstream,Theresa May,04/10/2017,Conference speech,https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/theresa-may-s-conservative-conference-speech-full-text/,1669,Conference,Y,Y,mayconference2017.txt,mayconference2017_cleaned.txt,Conservative conference speech 2017,"a little over forty years ago in a small village in Oxfordshire, I signed up to be a member of the Conservative Party. I did it because it was the party that had the ideas to build a better Britain. It understood the hard work and discipline necessary to see them through.
And it had at its heart a simple promise that spoke to me, my values and my aspirations: that each new generation in our country should be able to build a better future. That each generation should live the British Dream. And that dream is what I believe in.

But what the General Election earlier this year showed is that, forty years later, for too many people in our country that dream feels distant, our party's ability to deliver it is in question, and the British Dream that has inspired generations of Britons feels increasingly out of reach.
Now I called that election. And I know that all of you in this hall - your friends and your families - worked day and night to secure the right result. Because of your hard work we got 2.3 million more votes and achieved our highest vote share in 34 years. That simply would not have been possible without the long days and late nights, the phone calls, the leaflet drops. The weekends and evenings spent knocking on doors. So for everything that you do, let me say - thank you.
But we did not get the victory we wanted because our national campaign fell short. It was too scripted. Too presidential. And it allowed the Labour Party to paint us as the voice of continuity, when the public wanted to hear a message of change. I hold my hands up for that. I take responsibility. I led the campaign. And I am sorry.
But the choice before us now is clear: Do we give up, spend our time looking back? Or do we do our duty, look to the future and give the country the government it needs? This country will judge us harshly if we get this decision wrong.
Because all that should ever drive us is the duty we have to Britain and the historic mission of this party - this Conservative Party - to renew the British Dream in each new generation. That dream that says each generation should do better than the one before it. Each era should be better than the last. The dream that, for decades, has inspired people from around the world to come to Britain. To make their home in Britain. To build their lives in Britain. The dream that means the son of a bus driver from Pakistan serves in a Conservative Cabinet alongside the son of a single mother from a council estate in South-West London. And in a way, that dream is my story too.
I know that people think I'm not very emotional. I'm not the kind of person who wears their heart on their sleeve. And I don't mind being called things like the Ice Maiden - though perhaps George Osborne took the analogy a little far. But let me tell you something. My grandmother was a domestic servant, who worked as a lady's maid below stairs. She worked hard and made sacrifices, because she believed in a better future for her family. And that servant - that lady's maid - among her grandchildren boasts three professors and a prime minister.
That is why the British Dream inspires me. Why that dream of progress between the generations spurs me on. And it is why today at this conference, this Conservative Party must pledge to renew the British Dream in this country once again. To renew that dream is my purpose in politics. My reason for being. The thing that drives me on. And it has never wavered through good times and hard times. My belief that this Conservative government can renew it has always remained strong.
For whenever we are tested as a nation, this party steps up to the plate. Seven years ago, our challenge was to repair the damage of Labour's great recession - and we did it. The deficit is down. Spending is under control. And our economy is growing again. But we didn't limit ourselves to that ambition. We have achieved so much more.
An income tax cut for over 30 million people. Four million taken out of paying it at all. Employment up to a record high. Unemployment down to a historic low. Income inequality at its lowest for thirty years. More women in work than ever before.
Over 11,000 more doctors in our NHS. Over 11,000 more nurses on our hospital wards. Free childcare for 3 and 4 year olds doubled. 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools. 3 million more apprenticeships. Crime down by more than a third.
More young people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university than at any time in the history of our country. Britain leading the world in tackling climate change, eradicating global poverty, and countering terrorism wherever it rears its head. Same sex marriage on the statute book, so that two people who love each other can get married, no matter what their gender...
And a National Living Wage - giving a pay rise to the lowest earners - introduced not by the Labour Party, but by us, the Conservative Party. So let us never allow the Left to pretend they have a monopoly on compassion. This is the good a Conservative Government can do - and we should never let anyone forget it.
But it's easy when you've been in government for a while to fall into the trap of defending your record, and standing for the status quo. Yes, we're proud of the progress we have made, but the world doesn't stand still.
Change, as Disraeli taught us, is constant and inevitable. And we must bend it to our will. That means staking out an agenda for Britain - and uniting behind it too. And the agenda that I laid out on day one as prime minister still holds. It burns inside me just the same.
Because at its core, it's about sweeping away injustice - the barriers that mean for some the British Dream is increasingly out of reach. About saying what matters is not where you are from or who your parents are. The colour of your skin. Whether you're a man or a woman, rich or poor. From the inner city or an affluent suburb. How far you go in life should depend on you and your hard work.
That is why I have always taken on vested interests when they are working against the interests of the people. Called out those who abuse their positions of power and given a voice to those who have been ignored or silenced for too long.
And when people ask me why I put myself through it - the long hours, the pressure, the criticism and insults that inevitably go with the job - I tell them this: I do it to root out injustice and to give everyone in our country a voice. That's why when I reflect on my time in politics, the things that make me proud are not the positions I have held, the world leaders I have met, the great global gatherings to which I have been, but knowing that I made a difference. That I helped those who couldn't be heard.
Like the families of the 96 men, women and children who tragically lost their lives at Hillsborough. For years they saw people in authority closing ranks and acting against them, but now they are on the way to seeing justice served.
That's what I'm in this for. Like the victims and survivors of Child Sexual Abuse, ignored for years by people in positions of power, now on the long road to the truth. That's what I'm in this for.
Like Alexander Paul, a young man who came to this conference three years ago to tell his story. The story of a young black boy growing up in modern Britain who without causing any trouble - without doing anything wrong - found himself being stopped and searched by people in authority time and time and time again.
Alexander spoke so eloquently about his experience and how he came to mistrust those in positions of power as a result. So inspired by his example, we took action. We shook up the system, and the number of black people being stopped and searched has fallen by over two thirds. I am sad to have to tell you that last year, Alexander - who inspired us all with his passion - was diagnosed with brain cancer. And in June of this year he tragically passed away. He was just 21. Let us today remember the courage he showed in coming to our conference to speak out against injustice, take pride that we gave him a platform - and inspired by his example, redouble our efforts to give a voice to the voiceless at every opportunity. That's what I'm in this for.
And that same commitment is the reason why one of my first acts as Prime Minister was to establish the ground-breaking racial disparity audit - investigating how a person's race affects their treatment by public services, so that we can take action and respond.
We already know, for example, that members of Black and Minority Ethnic communities have a higher risk of illnesses such as high blood pressure that may lead to the need for an organ transplant.
But our ability to help people who need transplants is limited by the number of organ donors that come forward. That is why last year 500 people died because a suitable organ was not available. And there are 6,500 on the transplant list today. So to address this challenge that affects all communities in our country, we will change that system. Shifting the balance of presumption in favour of organ donation. Working on behalf of the most vulnerable. That's what I'm in this for.",0.9996534585952759,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

My wife: truly the best long term decision for a brighter future, I ever made.
I have been blessed in my life.
I have a wonderful wife and two daughters who make me proud every single day.
And I was also lucky enough to grow up in the most loving of homes.
My Dad was a GP and my Mum a pharmacist......you did need a smaller mention than last summer I know.
In so many ways, I wouldn't be standing here before you today without them.
They were—and are—my inspiration.
Thank you, Mum, thank you Dad.
Like so many of us in this hall, they understood the importance of community......and made sure that I did too.
They didn't believe community was some extension of government.
Rather, they understood community is sustained by individuals......by those who look out for their neighbour, treat others as they would like to be treated.
They understood the fundamental importance of service.
It was seeing the difference they made to people's lives that made me want to go into politics.
My mother set up her own pharmacy.
It was a proper family business.
We all chipped in; as a teenager I helped deliver prescriptions and do the books.
I learnt there the importance of being able to meet your commitments and make good on your promises.
My parents are long retired now.
But the Sunak pharmacy left me with a lasting respect for every small, family business.
This Conservative party, the party of the grocer's daughter and the pharmacist's son, will always be the party of enterprise, the party of small business.
I have been Prime Minister for almost a year now.
We have done good things in that time.
We have made progress on our five priorities......to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists, and stop the boats.
But today I want to share with you my reflections on what I have seen and what I have learnt doing this job.
I have seen up close the quality of our armed forces and intelligence services.
Truly, the finest in the world.
The debt of gratitude we owe them is why we are making this the best place to be a veteran.
I know we will deliver because we have a Minister for Veterans Affairs sitting in Cabinet.
Johnny served in Afghanistan; this is personal for him.
He stood with his fellow soldiers in battle......and now he is ensuring that it is this Conservative government making our country fit for our heroes.
We have backed our military with record investment.
Working with Ben—a great defence secretary-we put the defence budget on a sustainable footing.
Now, Grant will ensure that our advanced Aukus submarine alliance......with Australia and the United States......keeps the world safe for decades to come and create jobs here at home.
And, through our leading role in NATO, we remain the bulwark of European security.
All testament to this country's global reach and influence......and our determination to take long-term decisions in the national interest.
By contrast, just remember that not once, but twice......Labour tried to make a man Prime Minister who didn't believe in NATO......who would have surrendered our nuclear deterrent and who blames Britain for every problem.
Sir Keir Starmer might want us to forget about his repeated support for Jeremy Corbyn, but we never will.
You can never trust Labour with our country's security.
I am proud to say we have led the world in providing support to Ukraine.
We were the first country to send Western battle tanks to Kyiv, now more than ten others have followed.
We were the first country to send long range weapons to Kyiv, now France and the United States have followed.
We were the first country to agree to train Ukrainian pilots, now more than a dozen others have followed.
I say this to our allies, if we give President Zelensky the tools, the Ukrainians will finish the job.
Slava Ukraini.
Doing this job, I meet and talk to inspirational men and women across our country.
You see that our most potent strength, our most powerful resource, our greatest hope is our people.
But what I have learnt is that there is an undeniable sense that politics just doesn't work the way it should.
The feeling that Westminster is a broken system—and the same goes for Holyrood, Cardiff Bay, and Stormont.
It isn't anger, it is an exhaustion with politics.
In particular, politicians saying things, and then nothing ever changing.
And you know what: people are right.
Politics doesn't work the way it should.
We've had thirty years of a political system which incentivises the easy decision, not the right one.
Thirty years of vested interests standing in the way of change.
Thirty years of rhetorical ambition which achieves little more than a short-term headline.
And why?
Because our political system is too focused on short term advantage, not long-term success.
Politicians spent more time campaigning for change than actually delivering it.
It doesn't have to be this way.
I won't be this way.
Conference, our mission is to fundamentally change our country.
The Labour Party have set out their stall: to do and say as little as possible and hope no one notices.
They want to take people's votes for granted and keep doing politics the same old way.
It is a bet on people's apathy.
It does not speak to any higher purpose, or brighter future.
It is about power for the sake of power.
It is in short, everything that is wrong with our politics.
So, if this country is to change, then it can only be us who will deliver it.
Because if we do not our growth will be stunted.
More places will be left behind.
And ever more of our time will be spent debating the side issues and symptoms......rather than the deeper, more structural challenges we face.
We won't allow this to happen.
So, where a consensus is false, we will challenge it.
Where a vested interest is placing itself above the needs of the people, we will stop it.
And where common sense is under attack from an organised assault, we will defend it.
Today, I will set out how we will achieve this.
Beginning with a set of long-term decisions......to build a brighter future for our children......and fundamentally change our country.
And conference, you can already see my approach in the course I charted on net zero.
We Conservatives love our natural world.
We are determined to be good stewards of it.
In my own constituency, it is the beauty of the North York Moors......and Swaledale and Wensleydale that makes the place home.
We Conservatives also value frankness and consent.
We believe that politicians have a duty to treat household budgets with respect......and that change only endures if we bring people with us.
As you could tell by the reaction to my decision to chart a new course to Net Zero......it was not the easiest argument to have.
But when I looked at the reality of what people were being asked to do......the thousands of pounds people would need to pay......all of that disproportionately falling on the poorest in society by the way......and all of it not actually necessary in those time frames to meet our net zero targets......and in spite of us doing more than any other country—I concluded it simply was not right.
So, I decided to take a pragmatic, proportionate and realistic approach to reaching Net Zero.
And I won't take any lectures from other countries that have done far less than us......or from those for whom spending thousands of pounds of means nothing.
Change is difficult, particularly for those who disagree.
But remember this: we will still meet our international obligations......we will still meet our domestic targets and we will still get to Net Zero by 2050.
We have solved a problem and offered an unapologetic defence of good Conservative common sense.
So as much to the country, I make this promise to all of you in this hall.
As I did last summer: I will tell it as it is.
I will lead in a different way.
Because that is the only way to create the sort of change in our politics and in our country that we all desperately want to see.
Now I came into office in difficult circumstances......and I don't want to waste time debating the past because what matters is the future.
The facts are the facts.
You can't borrow your way out of inflation.
And if we want fundamental change in our country, we need a strong economy as a foundation.
That is why halving inflation was the first and most important of the five priorities I set out at the start of the year.
Everything that we want to achieve requires getting inflation under control.
'Inflation is the biggest destroyer of all—of industry, of jobs, of savings, and of society.'
'No policy which puts at the risk the defeat of inflation—no matter its short-term attraction—can be right.'
Not my words, but those of Margaret Thatcher: as true now as they were then.
I know you want tax cuts, I want them too—and we will deliver them.
But the best tax cut we can give people right now is to halve inflation and ease the cost of living.
And with inflation under control, our debt reduction will become easier......and as debt falls, confidence grows, and as confidence grows so too will our economy.
We need our economy to grow faster, and for people across the country to feel the benefits of that.
Like other Western economies, we haven't grown quickly enough in recent years.
But don't let Labour and the others talk down our country.
We now know that we have had one of the fastest recoveries from the pandemic of any major economy in Europe.
Since leaving the single market, we've grown faster than France and Germany.
Not despite Brexit, because of Brexit.
We have the largest life sciences, financial services, creative and tech sectors in all of Europe.
And we have near record numbers of people with the security that a job provides.
And if we want to keep growing......we have to create the conditions in which businesses can drive growth......and that's exactly what we're doing.
We still have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7.
And thanks to the Chancellor's business tax cuts......we are the best place to invest in the machinery and equipment that your business needs to grow.
Innovation drives growth in a modern economy......so, we also have the most generous tax regime for research and development in the G7.
And our Brexit freedoms make us ever more competitive.
From financial services to clinical trials to agriculture, we are creating a more agile regulatory system......freeing up businesses to drive the growth our country needs.
The fact we control our own trade policy now is why we can be the first European country to join the £11 trillion Pacific trade pact......linking us to the fastest growing region in the world and opening up new markets for our farmers and great British products.
We have new free ports from the Firth of Forth to the
Solent......ensuring the benefits of trade and investment are spread across our country.
And thank you Kemi for cutting away Brussels red tape and saving small businesses a billion pounds a year.
Brexit was more than a vote to leave the EU: it was a vote to change, to become something more.
It was a statement of our belief that Britain could begin a new story......one which reached all parts of our country and everyone in it.
We must keep making the case for taking back control because if we don't......our opponents will try and neuter this change.
To align us with the European Union so that we never seize the full opportunities of Brexit.
We know where Keir Starmer's heart lies on this issue—and we know he can't be trusted on it either.
First, he said he'd respect the referendum result.
Then he wanted a second referendum.
Then he wanted free movement.
Then he didn't.
He said he wouldn't try and renegotiate our deal.
Then he said he would.
And then just two weeks ago he was caught on camera telling a meeting of international politicians......that he now just wants to follow all the EU rules.
The irony isn't lost on me.
While we're busy thinking about the future of the United Kingdom...
Keir Starmer's just banging on about Europe.
You just cannot know what you are going to get with him.
The only thing that is certain is that it won't be what he is promising you.
But the worst thing about Sir Keir is that he just says whatever he thinks will benefit him the most.
It doesn't matter whether he can deliver it......doesn't matter if it's true......it doesn't matter if he said the opposite just a few weeks or months ago.
He is the walking definition of the thirty-year political status quo I am here to end.
That is why we have to beat him—and Conference that is why we will!
If we are to create change and drive growth across our country, then we must get our infrastructure right.
A false consensus has taken root that all that matters are links between our big conurbations.
This consensus said that our national economic regeneration should be driven by cities......at the exclusion of everywhere else.
It said that the most important connection those cities could have was to London, and not anywhere else.
And it said that the only links that mattered were north to south: not east to west.
What we really need, though, is better transport connections in the North.
A new Network North that will join up our great towns and cities in the North and the Midlands.
I wanted to come here to Manchester today, to say that this will be our priority, our focus, our project.
HS2 is the ultimate example of the old consensus.
The result is a project whose costs have more than doubled, which has been repeatedly delayed and it is not scheduled to reach here in Manchester for almost two decades......and for which the economic case has massively weakened with the changes to business travel post Covid.
I say, to those who backed the project in the first place, the facts have changed.
And the right thing to do when the facts change, is to have the courage to change direction.
And so, I am ending this long running saga.
I am cancelling the rest of the HS2 project.
And in its place, we will reinvest every single penny...£36 billion pounds......in hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country.
This means £36 billion of investment in the projects that will make a real difference across our nation.
As a result of the decision we are taking today......every region outside of London will receive the same or more government investment than they would have done under HS2......with quicker results.
No government has ever developed a more ambitious scheme for Northern transport than our new Network North.
This is the right way to drive growth and spread opportunity across our country. To level up.
With our new Network North, you will be able to get from Manchester to the new station in Bradford in 30 minutes......Sheffield in 42 minutes......and to Hull in 84 minutes on a fully, electrified line.
Don't worry. There's more.
We'll protect the £12 billion pounds to link up Manchester and Liverpool as planned......and we will engage with local leaders on how best to deliver that scheme.
We'll build the Midlands Rail Hub, connecting 50 stations.
We'll help Andy Street extend the West Midlands Metro...
We'll build the Leeds tram, electrify the North Wales main line...
Upgrade the A1, the A2, the A5, the M6...
There is more. There's lots more....and we'll connect our Union with the A75 boosting links between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
We'll fund the Shipley bypass, the Blyth relief road and deliver 70 other road schemes.
We'll resurface roads across the country.
We'll bring back the Don Valley line.
We'll upgrade the energy coast line between Carlisle, Workington, and Barrow.
Build hundreds of other schemes.
And keep the £2 bus fare across the whole country.
I challenge anyone to tell me with a straight face that all of that isn't what the North really needs.
Our plan will drive far more growth and opportunity here in the North than a faster train to London ever would.
As John Stevenson and Ben Houchen have long argued, east west links are more important than north south ones.
Given how far along construction is, we will complete the line from Birmingham to Euston.
And yes, HS2 trains will still run here to Manchester. And journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham, and London by 30 minutes.
And I say this to Andy Street, a man I have huge admiration and respect for, I know we have different views on HS2. But I also know we can work together to ensure a faster, stronger spine: quicker trains and more capacity between Birmingham and Manchester.
The management of HS2 will no longer be responsible for the Euston site.
There must be some accountability for the mistakes made, for the mismanagement of this project.
We will instead create a new Euston development zone......building thousands of new homes for the next generation of homeowners, new business opportunities and a station that delivers the capacity we need...
And in doing so, for the first time in the life cycle of this project - we will have cut costs.
The £6.5 billion of savings that Mark and I are making will be taken from the Euston site......and given to the rest of country.
The decision I have made and the stance I am taking will be attacked.
They will say that halting it signals a lack of ambition.
There will be people I respect, people in our own party, who will oppose it.
But there is nothing ambitious about simply pouring more and more money into the wrong project.
There is nothing long-term about ignoring your real infrastructure needs......so, you can spend an ever-larger amount on one grand project.
They will say that we have already spent so much on it that it would be embarrassing to stop.
That, though, would be an absurd reason to continue: an abdication of leadership.
They will say that there is somehow a cross party consensus on the project...
As I have already said... that consensus is wrong.
For too long, people in Westminster have invested in the transport they want......not the transport the rest of the country, particularly the North and Midlands, wants and needs.
And to those who disagree, who will focus on what I have stopped, I ask you to consider what we have just created with Network North.
An alternative, which in place of one delayed and over running project......will now begin hundreds upon hundreds of new projects......large and small, road and rail, bus and train, covering the whole country.
That will be delivered faster.
That will see every region receiving more investment than they would have done.
You can't have both.
So those who wish to disagree with me, I respect that.
But they should have the honesty to admit that they would now be cancelling the hundreds of alternative projects......right across the country, that people will benefit from instead.
Conference, I think our new plan is simply a better long-term investment of £36 billion of taxpayers' money.
We need to bring this willingness to make the right decision, not the easy one......to every aspect of our national life.
The NHS is important to us all.
It is the birthright of every person in this country.
It was the NHS and social care staff who worked night and day to get us through the pandemic.
Our commitment to the principle of an NHS free at the point of use is immovable.
And this Conservative government is putting record resources into our NHS, and social care too.
But we Conservatives know that you don't measure your affection for the NHS......just by how much money you put in, but by how you reform it for the challenges ahead.
I know that right now waiting lists are patients' most pressing concern.
Just as in Scotland and Wales, they have risen because of the pandemic.
And now strikes have led to more than a million cancelled appointments.
Now, this is a reasonable government.
We have negotiated and reached pay deals with over a million NHS workers, including nurses and hospital porters.
We have met the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies for junior doctors and consultants in full.
We have cut their taxes on their pensions as they requested.
But they continue to demand, massive unaffordable pay rises.
And that they have chosen to walk out this week says it all.
This strike is all about politics, not patients.
These strikes are not in the spirit of the NHS.
This year we celebrate its 75 years of service......and one of my abiding aims as your Prime Minister is to set the NHS up for the next 75.
True believers in the promise of the NHS want it to reflect the world we live in today.
That means a higher quality service that offers you—the patient—more choice......allowing you to use any provider, independent or NHS, free of charge, if that will get you treated quicker.
A common-sense reform that this Conservative government has made.
Next, Steve and I want to give the NHS the staff it needs.
For decades, we have not trained enough doctors and nurses.
The result: the NHS either hiring staff from abroad or paying temporary agency workers huge fees.
And we are ending that with the first ever long-term workforce plan for our health service.
Let me repeat that, the first ever long-term workforce plan.
It says everything about the short-termism of our politics that for the last 75 years......not a single government has planned for how many doctors and nurses the NHS will need in the decades ahead.
Our plan doubles the number of students training to be doctors and nurses.
But it is also a reform plan for the NHS with new ways of training......new roles and new ways of working, all driving up productivity.
I know vested interests will oppose some of these measures.
But we Conservatives must do the right thing and make the changes that will enable the NHS......to work as productively as the best healthcare systems anywhere in the world.
And this is what a long-term decision really is.
Given it takes up to 15 years to train a consultant, there's no politics in this investment, it's not about credit.
It's about our kids and their kids, they'll get a much better and stronger NHS.
And that's why we're here.
That's why we Conservatives do what we do, up and down the country from Whitehall to Town Hall.
We're building a better future for the next generation.
But to ease the more fundamental burden of demand on the NHS......we need more preventative care to stop people having to go to hospital in the first place.
We must tackle the single biggest entirely preventable cause of ill-health, disability, and death and that is smoking.
In our country smoking causes one in four cancer deaths.
It kills 64,000 people a year and leads to almost one hospital admission every minute.
It significantly increases the risk of strokes, heart disease, dementia, and stillbirth.
Now we've made great progress in tackling smoking.
The number of people smoking is down by two thirds since the 1970s.
But if we are to do the right thing for our kids we must try and stop teenagers taking up cigarettes in the first place.
Because without a significant change......thousands of children will start smoking in the coming years and have their lives cut short as a result.
People take up cigarettes when they are young.
Four in five smokers have started by the time they are 20. Later, the vast majority try to quit.
But many fail because they are addicted and they wish had never taken up the habit in the first place.
If we could break that cycle......if we could stop the start......then we would be on our way to ending the biggest cause of preventable death and disease in our country.
So, I propose that in future we raise the smoking age by one year, every year.
That means a 14 year old today will never legally be sold a cigarette......and that they—and their generation—can grow up smoke free.
We know this works.
When we raised the smoking age to 18, smoking prevalence dropped by 30 percent in that age group.
When the US raised the age to 21, the smoking rate dropped by 39 per cent in that age group.
Smoking places huge pressures on the NHS and costs our country £17 billion a year.
We have a chance to cut cancer deaths by a quarter, significantly ease those pressures and protect our children, and we should take it.
This is not a values judgement on people who smoke.
I don't believe it would be fair to take away the rights of anyone to smoke who currently does so......and the vote on this in parliament will be a free vote......as the bar on smoking in public places was and raising the smoking age to 18 was.
There will be no government whip, it is a matter of conscience...
And I want you all, and the country, to know where mine is.
For a Conservative, measures that restrict choice are never easy.
I know not everyone in this hall will agree with me on this.
But I have spent a long time weighing up this decision.
Simply put: unlike all other legal products, there is no safe level of smoking.
And what has ultimately swayed me is that none of us, not even those who smoke, want our children to grow up to be smokers.
This change can make that a reality.
It will save more lives than any other decision we could take.
And as any parent or teacher knows, one of the most worrying trends at the moment is the rise in vaping among children: one in five children have used vapes.
We we must act before it becomes endemic.
So, we will also bring forward measures to restrict the availability of vapes to our children. Looking at flavours, packaging, displays and disposable vapes.
As Prime Minister I have an obligation to do what I think is the right thing for our country in the long term.
And as Conservatives we have never shirked that responsibility.
We have always been at the front of society, leading it.
And when we have the tools at our disposal......to deal with the biggest cause of preventable illness and death in our country...
To cut cancer deaths by a quarter......to significantly reduce long term pressure on our NHS......and to do for our children what we all, in our heart of hearts, know is right......we must act, we must lead.
Conference, we must put the next generation first.
And that is what I will do.
But all the boldness in the world will only mean so much......if we can't similarly deal with matters of fundamental sovereignty, safety, and control.
I'm talking of course about illegal immigration.
It is non-negotiable that you, the British people decide who comes here... and not criminal gangs.
Those gangs ply a trade that leads to innocent people dying, we have a moral duty to defeat this evil — and we will.
I never pretended that stopping the boats will be easy.
At the time I committed the government to delivering that goal the consensus was simple......there was nothing we could do about it.
They pointed to four years of growing crossings and said 'impossible.'
Well conference: they were wrong.
It is not impossible and we are proving it.
Small boat crossings are, for the first time since the phenomenon began, down 20 per cent this year.
All while entry into Europe is up.
We are by no means where we want to be.
But don't let anyone tell you we aren't making progress.
We are.
And we will get there.
Our new law will ensure that if you come here illegally, you will be detained and swiftly removed.
I am confident that once flights start going regularly to Rwanda, the boats will stop coming.
Just look at how our returns agreement with Albania has seen the numbers coming from there fall by ninety per cent.
I am confident that our approach complies with our international obligations.
But know this, I will do whatever is necessary to stop the boats.
By contrast, Labour's plan is to cook up some deal with the EU......which could see us accepting around 100,000 of Europe's asylum seekers.
If your answer to illegal migration is to increase it...
You clearly just don't get it.
And that's why we have got to stop them.
And that's because on this and so many other issues Labour simply don't share our and the country's values.
My values are simple: service, family, work.
I was brought up to understand the value of work.
Work gives you security, work gives you purpose.
When the pandemic hit, we were faced with the prospect of 12 million people losing that security, that purpose overnight.
And once you're out of work, it can be hard to get back in.
I wasn't prepared to cast 12 million people into that darkness.
I am proud that furlough not only prevented this......but helped ensure our economy recovered more strongly from the pandemic......than France, Germany, and Japan.
Never forget the scale of what we did for so many.
In six weeks, we did something that had never been done before: from scratch.
I was told it wasn't possible, that it wouldn't work, but I got it done.
Furlough was compassionate Conservatism in action.
If furlough was one thing that helped us get through Covid, then Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reforms were another.
The old system could not have coped with the pressure in the way that universal credit did.
But we have more to do.
We must end the national scandal......where our benefits system declares that more than two million people of working age are incapable of actually doing any.
That's not Conservative, that's not compassionate—that must change.
In 2011, one in five of those doing a work capability assessment were deemed unfit to work.
But the latest figure now stands at 65 per cent.
Are people three times sicker today than they were a decade ago?
No, of course not.
It's not good for our economy......it is not fair on taxpayers who have to pick up the bill......and it's a tragedy for those two million people being written off.
I refuse to accept this and that is why we are going to change the rules so that those who can work, do work.
Your values and your priorities should be expressed in everything the public sector does.
Too often it is not.
In too many parts of our permanent state, virtue-signalling has replaced common sense.
As Suella has said, there is no such thing as a minor crime.
If the police tolerate crime and anti-social behaviour in any form, we will have more crime of all sorts.
So, that's why we now have record numbers of police officers and every crime should be investigated. Our streets will be safer, our communities more secure, no one should be afraid to walk home alone at night.
Our London mayoral candidate Susan Hall is doing a great job of holding Sadiq Khan to account for his failings on policing.
Londoners, you will be safer with Susan.
And I am clear: there are some crimes so heinous......that those who perpetrate them should spend the rest of their lives behind bars.
So, I can confirm that we will legislate for sexual and sadistic murders to carry a full life term......with no prospect of release.
We are going to change this country and that means life means life.
Now that shouldn't be a controversial position.
The vast majority of hardworking people agree with it.
And it also shouldn't be controversial for parents to know what their children are being taught in school about relationships.
Patients should know when hospitals are talking about men or women.
And we shouldn't get bullied into believing that people can be any sex they want to be.
They can't; a man is a man and a woman is a woman.
That's just common sense.
We also should never be afraid to talk about the thing that matters most to most of us, family.
Whenever you want to talk about family, someone whispers 'is that wise Prime Minister?'
You'll be accused of promoting a one size fits all view.
But in this Conservative Party......the party that legislated for same sex marriage and is investing record amounts in childcare......we know that what matters is that love cascades down the generations.
It is family that cares for us at the beginning of our life......it is family that helps us learn......it is family that sustains us......and in old age it is family that lightens the autumn of our days.
Family matters, and as proud Conservatives we should never be afraid to say that.
And there's another family that matters to us all, our family of nations: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Today, our Union is the strongest it has been in a quarter of a century.
The forces of separatism are in retreat across our country.
Nicola Sturgeon wanted to go down in the history books as the woman who broke up our country......but now it looks like she may go down for very different reasons.
We are a remarkable combination of four nations with a proud history......and that history should give us enormous confidence in our future.
My grandparents did not emigrate to just Leicester or Southampton, but to the United Kingdom.
They came here because our country stands for a set of values.
We are the home of fair play, the best of British.
We are the place for those who want to add to our national story.
The United Kingdom has done a huge amount for my family.
I often think about how different our lives would be......if my grandparents had not left India and East Africa all those years ago.
I owe our country everything.
And it is my duty to do what I can to help this country take the right long-term decisions for the years ahead.
This United Kingdom is also the most successful multi-ethnic democracy on earth.
And our party has led the way on that.
We had the first ethnic minority Prime Minister when Queen Victoria was still on the throne......we have had three female Prime Ministers......and I stand before you today as the first non-white leader in our country's history.
Meanwhile, Labour's last three leaders all live within the same square mile of North London.
When the Richmond Conservative Association selected me in North Yorkshire, people in other countries couldn't understand it.
One American magazine even sent a reporter to Yorkshire to write about how...... 'a candidate of the wrong race [could] cost the Tories one of the safest seats in England?'
But they should not have projected their own prejudices onto our country.
The people of North Yorkshire were not interested in my colour, but my character.
Never let anyone tell you that this is a racist country.
It is not.
My story is a British story.
A story about how a family can go from arriving here with little to Downing Street in three generations.
What does the Conservative Party offer a family of immigrants?
The chance to become Energy Secretary, Business Secretary, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary...
Even the chance to become Prime Minister.
When I first became an MP, my grandfather came to parliament to see me.
As we stood in Westminster Hall, on that floor which Disraeli and Churchill had walked across so many times......my grandfather got out his mobile phone and made a quick phone call.
I was a new MP and I wasn't quite sure whether phones were allowed there or not.
I was like, Nanaji, can this not wait a moment.
He replied that he was calling the landlady he had when he had first arrived in this country:
He said to me, 'I just wanted to tell her where I was standing.'
I am proud to be the first British Asian Prime Minister, but you know what......I'm even prouder that it's just not a big deal.
And just remember: it was the Conservative Party who made that happen, not the Labour Party.
If we want to change the direction of our country and build a better future......nothing is more important than making our education system the best it can be.
When our party came to power in 2010, our schools were slipping down international league tables.
Now, they are rapidly rising.
Of what we have done in government since 2010, what I am proudest of is our record on education.
With Michael and Nick Gibb, we took on a failed ideology.
We brought back proper knowledge.
We empowered reformers.
We gave parents more choice and helped them to hold schools to account.
But, perhaps, the most profound thing we have done......is to disprove the idea there is something pre-destined about who will succeed and who won't.
We have state schools in some of the most deprived parts of the country, producing some of the best results.
These state schools, empowered by reform, don't think there are limits to these children because of the postcode they were born in.
Rather, they demand, inspire, and deliver excellence.
A Labour government would never have done this.
Rather, Labour pursued the false dream of 50 per cent of children going to university and abandoned apprenticeships.
This assumption that the only route to success was the university route......was one of the great mistakes of the last 30 years.
It led to thousands of young people being ripped off by degrees......that did nothing to increase their employability or earnings potential.
So, we are stopping universities from enrolling students on courses that do nothing for their life chances.
Under us, no more rip off degrees.
And if you want to know how much I value apprenticeships, look at the fact that in Gillian we have our first ever apprentice to be Education Secretary.
Today, I want to build on these Conservative achievements and take a long-term decision to address the problems with our 16 to 19 education system.
Technical education is not given the respect it deserves.
Students don't spend enough time in the classroom.
A quarter of our children leave education without the basic literacy and numeracy they need to fulfil their potential.
And our students study too narrow a range of subjects.
Today, I am changing all of that, pulling one of the biggest levers we have to change the direction of our country.
We will introduce the new rigorous, knowledge rich Advanced British Standard......which will bring together A-Levels and T-Levels into a new, single qualification for our school leavers.
First, this will finally deliver on the promise of parity of esteem between academic and technical education.
Because all students will sit the Advanced British Standard.
Second, we will raise the floor, ensuring that our children leave school literate and numerate.
Because with the Advanced British Standard all students will study some form of English and maths to 18, with extra help for those who struggle most.
In our country no child should be left behind.
Third, our 16- to 19-year-olds spend around a third less time in the classroom than some of our competitors.
We must change this.
So, with our Advanced British Standard, students will spend at least 195 hours more with a teacher.
And fourth, A-Level students, generally, only do three subjects compared to the seven studied by our economic competitors.
The Advanced British Standard will change that too, with students now, typically, studying five subjects......and thanks to the extra teaching time that we are introducing......this greater breadth won't come at the expense of depth which is such a strength of our system.
Our new plan will require more teachers in the coming years.
So, I can announce today that in order to attract and retain more teachers......those who teach key subjects in schools and, for the first time, in our further education colleges too......will receive special bonuses of up to £30,000 tax free over the first five years of their career.
Our teachers do one of the most valuable jobs in our society, and we should reward them for that.
And Conference, I can tell you: my main funding priority in every spending review from now on will be education.
Why?
Because it is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet.
It is the best economic policy, the best social policy, the best moral policy.
It the best way to spread opportunity and to create a more prosperous society. It is not just my way. Conference, it is the Conservative way.
I know times have been tough.
We have all had to deal with unprecedented challenges.
And I will be straight with you: we have mountains to overcome still.
But today we have made three huge decisions to change the direction of our country.
We will give Britain the infrastructure it needs......protect the long-term future of our NHS and cut cancer deaths by a quarter......and create the best education system in the Western world......to set our children up for the opportunities of the future.
If we commit, if we come together, then we can achieve truly great things.
We can build a country where work is truly valued...
Where welfare is a safety net and not a way of life...
Where small businesses drive our economy...
Where innovation makes life better...
Where our NHS is properly funded and properly reformed...
Where our children are the best educated in the western world...
Whether that's at university or yes: through an apprenticeship.
Where the scourge of anti-social behaviour is treated as the crime it is and not some social condition...
Where for the most violent offenders life means life...
Where the people and their government decides who can come here and who can't...
Where the next generation can achieve the dream of owning their own home...
Where the elderly grow old with dignity and where the young grow up with opportunity...
Where decency and mutual respect bind communities together.
Where the very idea of Britain is a symbol of hope and stability across the world...
And where our United Kingdom remains united.
All this and more is ours if we want it......but we have to fight for it.
At the next election, the choice the people face is bigger than party politics:
Do we want a government committed to making long term decisions......prepared to be radical in the face of challenges, and to take on vested interests......or do we want to stand still—and quietly accept more of the same?
You either think this country needs to change or you don't.
And if you do, then you should stand with me—and every person in this hall.
You should stand with the Conservatives.
Today this party put the needs of the British people first.
We've taken the decision many should have done: but didn't.
We've ended the HS2 drama......and in its place will embark upon a full-scale national reinvestment......in the infrastructure people actually use and want......and the skilled workforce who'll build it.
And no more hiding: no more pretending in the face of overwhelming evidence.
Too many sons and daughters, fathers and mothers are lost to lung cancer, heart disease, dementia, still birth and we can change that.
Today we went beyond ideology and put the people first again......and committed ourselves to ensure our children and grandchildren......can be the first generation that doesn't have to suffer the false choice to quit smoking or not......because they will have never started.
Today we set a course for our education system that will set our children up for the opportunities of the future.
No more rip off degrees; no more low aspiration; no more denigration of technical education.
Just the best education system in the Western world.
We will be bold.
We will be radical.
We will face resistance and we will meet it.
We will give the country what it so sorely needs, and yet too often has been denied:
A government prepared to make long term decisions so that we can build a brighter future—for everyone.
Be in no doubt: it is time for a change.
And we are it.

They voted to shape a brighter future for our country.
They voted to leave the European Union and embrace the world.
And they did so with their eyes open: accepting that the road ahead will be uncertain at times, but believing that it leads towards a brighter future for their children - and their grandchildren too.
And it is the job of this government to deliver it. That means more than negotiating our new relationship with the EU. It means taking the opportunity of this great moment of national change to step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be.
My answer is clear. I want this United Kingdom to emerge from this period of change stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before. I want us to be a secure, prosperous, tolerant country - a magnet for international talent and a home to the pioneers and innovators who will shape the world ahead. I want us to be a truly Global Britain - the best friend and neighbour to our European partners, but a country that reaches beyond the borders of Europe too. A country that goes out into the world to build relationships with old friends and new allies alike.
I want Britain to be what we have the potential, talent and ambition to be. A great, global trading nation that is respected around the world and strong, confident and united at home.
That is why this government has a Plan for Britain. One that gets us the right deal abroad but also ensures we get a better deal for ordinary working people at home.
It's why that plan sets out how we will use this moment of change to build a stronger economy and a fairer society by embracing genuine economic and social reform.
Why our new Modern Industrial Strategy is being developed, to ensure every nation and area of the United Kingdom can make the most of the opportunities ahead.
Why we will go further to reform our schools to ensure every child has the knowledge and the skills they need to thrive in post-Brexit Britain.
Why as we continue to bring the deficit down, we will take a balanced approach by investing in our economic infrastructure - because it can transform the growth potential of our economy and improve the quality of people's lives across the whole country.
It's why we will put the preservation of our precious Union at the heart of everything we do. Because it is only by coming together as one great union of nations and people that we can make the most of the opportunities ahead. The result of the referendum was not a decision to turn inward and retreat from the world.
Because Britain's history and culture is profoundly internationalist.
We are a European country - and proud of our shared European heritage - but we are also a country that has always looked beyond Europe to the wider world. That is why we are one of the most racially diverse countries in Europe, one of the most multicultural members of the European Union, and why - whether we are talking about India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, countries in Africa or those that are closer to home in Europe - so many of us have close friends and relatives from across the world.
Instinctively, we want to travel to, study in, trade with countries not just in Europe but beyond the borders of our continent. Even now as we prepare to leave the EU, we are planning for the next biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in 2018 - a reminder of our unique and proud global relationships.
And it is important to recognise this fact. June the 23rd was not the moment Britain chose to step back from the world. It was the moment we chose to build a truly Global Britain.
I know that this - and the other reasons Britain took such a decision - is not always well understood among our friends and allies in Europe. And I know many fear that this might herald the beginning of a greater unravelling of the EU.
But let me be clear: I do not want that to happen. It would not be in the best interests of Britain. It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain's national interest that the EU should succeed. And that is why I hope in the months and years ahead we will all reflect on the lessons of Britain's decision to leave.
So let me take this opportunity to set out the reasons for our decision and to address the people of Europe directly.
It's not simply because our history and culture is profoundly internationalist, important though that is. Many in Britain have always felt that the United Kingdom's place in the European Union came at the expense of our global ties, and of a bolder embrace of free trade with the wider world.
There are other important reasons too.
Our political traditions are different. Unlike other European countries, we have no written constitution, but the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty is the basis of our unwritten constitutional settlement. We have only a recent history of devolved governance - though it has rapidly embedded itself - and we have little history of coalition government.
The public expect to be able to hold their governments to account very directly, and as a result supranational institutions as strong as those created by the European Union sit very uneasily in relation to our political history and way of life.
And, while I know Britain might at times have been seen as an awkward member state, the European Union has struggled to deal with the diversity of its member countries and their interests. It bends towards uniformity, not flexibility.
David Cameron's negotiation was a valiant final attempt to make it work for Britain - and I want to thank all those elsewhere in Europe who helped him reach an agreement - but the blunt truth, as we know, is that there was not enough flexibility on many important matters for a majority of British voters.
Now I do not believe that these things apply uniquely to Britain. Britain is not the only member state where there is a strong attachment to accountable and democratic government, such a strong internationalist mindset, or a belief that diversity within Europe should be celebrated. And so I believe there is a lesson in Brexit not just for Britain but, if it wants to succeed, for the EU itself.
Because our continent's great strength has always been its diversity. And there are 2 ways of dealing with different interests. You can respond by trying to hold things together by force, tightening a vice-like grip that ends up crushing into tiny pieces the very things you want to protect. Or you can respect difference, cherish it even, and reform the EU so that it deals better with the wonderful diversity of its member states.
So to our friends across Europe, let me say this.
Our vote to leave the European Union was no rejection of the values we share. The decision to leave the EU represents no desire to become more distant to you, our friends and neighbours. It was no attempt to do harm to the EU itself or to any of its remaining member states. We do not want to turn the clock back to the days when Europe was less peaceful, less secure and less able to trade freely. It was a vote to restore, as we see it, our parliamentary democracy, national self-determination, and to become even more global and internationalist in action and in spirit.
We will continue to be reliable partners, willing allies and close friends. We want to buy your goods and services, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship.
You will still be welcome in this country as we hope our citizens will be welcome in yours. At a time when together we face a serious threat from our enemies, Britain's unique intelligence capabilities will continue to help to keep people in Europe safe from terrorism. And at a time when there is growing concern about European security, Britain's servicemen and women, based in European countries including Estonia, Poland and Romania, will continue to do their duty.
We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe.
And that is why we seek a new and equal partnership - between an independent, self-governing, Global Britain and our friends and allies in the EU.
Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out. We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.
No, the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. And my job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do.
So today I want to outline our objectives for the negotiation ahead. Twelve objectives that amount to one big goal: a new, positive and constructive partnership between Britain and the European Union.
And as we negotiate that partnership, we will be driven by some simple principles: we will provide as much certainty and clarity as we can at every stage. And we will take this opportunity to make Britain stronger, to make Britain fairer, and to build a more Global Britain too.
The first objective is crucial. We will provide certainty wherever we can.
We are about to enter a negotiation. That means there will be give and take. There will have to be compromises. It will require imagination on both sides. And not everybody will be able to know everything at every stage.
But I recognise how important it is to provide business, the public sector, and everybody with as much certainty as possible as we move through the process.
So where we can offer that certainty, we will do so.
That is why last year we acted quickly to give clarity about farm payments and university funding. And it is why, as we repeal the European Communities Act, we will convert the 'acquis' - the body of existing EU law - into British law.
This will give the country maximum certainty as we leave the EU. The same rules and laws will apply on the day after Brexit as they did before. And it will be for the British Parliament to decide on any changes to that law after full scrutiny and proper Parliamentary debate.
And when it comes to Parliament, there is one other way in which I would like to provide certainty. I can confirm today that the Government will put the final deal that is agreed between the UK and the EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament, before it comes into force.
Our second guiding principle is to build a stronger Britain.
That means taking control of our own affairs, as those who voted in their millions to leave the European Union demanded we must.
So we will take back control of our laws and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in Britain. Leaving the European Union will mean that our laws will be made in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. And those laws will be interpreted by judges not in Luxembourg but in courts across this country.
Because we will not have truly left the European Union if we are not in control of our own laws.
A stronger Britain demands that we do something else - strengthen the precious union between the 4 nations of the United Kingdom.
At this momentous time, it is more important than ever that we face the future together, united by what makes us strong: the bonds that unite us as a people, and our shared interest in the UK being an open, successful trading nation in the future.
And I hope that same spirit of unity will apply in Northern Ireland in particular over the coming months in the Assembly elections, and the main parties there will work together to re-establish a partnership government as soon as possible.
Foreign affairs are of course the responsibility of the UK government, and in dealing with them we act in the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom. As prime minister, I take that responsibility seriously.
I have also been determined from the start that the devolved administrations should be fully engaged in this process.
That is why the government has set up a Joint Ministerial Committee on EU Negotiations, so ministers from each of the UK's devolved administrations can contribute to the process of planning for our departure from the European Union.
We have already received a paper from the Scottish government, and look forward to receiving a paper from the Welsh government shortly. Both papers will be considered as part of this important process. We won't agree on everything, but I look forward to working with the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole of the United Kingdom.
Part of that will mean working very carefully to ensure that - as powers are repatriated from Brussels back to Britain - the right powers are returned to Westminster, and the right powers are passed to the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
As we do so, our guiding principle must be to ensure that - as we leave the European Union - no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union are created,
That means maintaining the necessary common standards and frameworks for our own domestic market, empowering the UK as an open, trading nation to strike the best trade deals around the world, and protecting the common resources of our islands.
And as we do this, I should equally be clear that no decisions currently taken by the devolved administrations will be removed from them.
We cannot forget that, as we leave, the United Kingdom will share a land border with the EU, and maintaining that Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland will be an important priority for the UK in the talks ahead. There has been a Common Travel Area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland for many years.
Indeed, it was formed before either of our 2 countries were members of the European Union. And the family ties and bonds of affection that unite our 2 countries mean that there will always be a special relationship between us.
So we will work to deliver a practical solution that allows the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the Republic, while protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom's immigration system.
Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past, so we will make it a priority to deliver a practical solution as soon as we can.
The third principle is to build a fairer Britain. That means ensuring it is fair to everyone who lives and works in this country.
And that is why we will ensure we can control immigration to Britain from Europe.
We will continue to attract the brightest and the best to work or study in Britain - indeed openness to international talent must remain one of this country's most distinctive assets - but that process must be managed properly so that our immigration system serves the national interest.
So we will get control of the number of people coming to Britain from the EU.
Because while controlled immigration can bring great benefits - filling skills shortages, delivering public services, making British businesses the world-beaters they often are - when the numbers get too high, public support for the system falters.
In the last decade or so, we have seen record levels of net migration in Britain, and that sheer volume has put pressure on public services, like schools, stretched our infrastructure, especially housing, and put a downward pressure on wages for working class people. As home secretary for 6 years, I know that you cannot control immigration overall when there is free movement to Britain from Europe.
Britain is an open and tolerant country. We will always want immigration, especially high-skilled immigration, we will always want immigration from Europe, and we will always welcome individual migrants as friends. But the message from the public before and during the referendum campaign was clear: Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe. And that is what we will deliver.
Fairness demands that we deal with another issue as soon as possible too. We want to guarantee the rights of EU citizens who are already living in Britain, and the rights of British nationals in other member states, as early as we can.
I have told other EU leaders that we could give people the certainty they want straight away, and reach such a deal now.
Many of them favour such an agreement - 1 or 2 others do not - but I want everyone to know that it remains an important priority for Britain - and for many other member states - to resolve this challenge as soon as possible. Because it is the right and fair thing to do.
And a fairer Britain is a country that protects and enhances the rights people have at work.That is why, as we translate the body of European law into our domestic regulations, we will ensure that workers rights are fully protected and maintained.
Indeed, under my leadership, not only will the government protect the rights of workers set out in European legislation, we will build on them. Because under this government, we will make sure legal protection for workers keeps pace with the changing labour market - and that the voices of workers are heard by the boards of publicly-listed companies for the first time.
But the great prize for this country - the opportunity ahead - is to use this moment to build a truly Global Britain. A country that reaches out to old friends and new allies alike. A great, global, trading nation. And one of the firmest advocates for free trade anywhere in the world.
That starts with our close friends and neighbours in Europe. So as a priority, we will pursue a bold and ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union.
This agreement should allow for the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU's member states. It should give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within European markets - and let European businesses do the same in Britain.
But I want to be clear. What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market.
European leaders have said many times that membership means accepting the '4 freedoms' of goods, capital, services and people. And being out of the EU but a member of the single market would mean complying with the EU's rules and regulations that implement those freedoms, without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are. It would mean accepting a role for the European Court of Justice that would see it still having direct legal authority in our country.
It would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all.
And that is why both sides in the referendum campaign made it clear that a vote to leave the EU would be a vote to leave the single market.
So we do not seek membership of the single market. Instead we seek the greatest possible access to it through a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement.
That agreement may take in elements of current single market arrangements in certain areas - on the export of cars and lorries for example, or the freedom to provide financial services across national borders - as it makes no sense to start again from scratch when Britain and the remaining Member States have adhered to the same rules for so many years.
But I respect the position taken by European leaders who have been clear about their position, just as I am clear about mine. So an important part of the new strategic partnership we seek with the EU will be the pursuit of the greatest possible access to the single market, on a fully reciprocal basis, through a comprehensive free trade agreement.
And because we will no longer be members of the single market, we will not be required to contribute huge sums to the EU budget. There may be some specific European programmes in which we might want to participate. If so, and this will be for us to decide, it is reasonable that we should make an appropriate contribution. But the principle is clear: the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end.
But it is not just trade with the EU we should be interested in. A Global Britain must be free to strike trade agreements with countries from outside the European Union too.
Because important though our trade with the EU is and will remain, it is clear that the UK needs to increase significantly its trade with the fastest growing export markets in the world.
Since joining the EU, trade as a percentage of GDP has broadly stagnated in the UK. That is why it is time for Britain to get out into the world and rediscover its role as a great, global, trading nation.
This is such a priority for me that when I became Prime Minister I established, for the first time, a Department for International Trade, led by Liam Fox.
We want to get out into the wider world, to trade and do business all around the globe. Countries including China, Brazil, and the Gulf States have already expressed their interest in striking trade deals with us. We have started discussions on future trade ties with countries like Australia, New Zealand and India. And President-Elect Trump has said Britain is not ""at the back of the queue"" for a trade deal with the United States, the world's biggest economy, but front of the line.
I know my emphasis on striking trade agreements with countries outside Europe has led to questions about whether Britain seeks to remain a member of the EU's Customs Union. And it is true that full Customs Union membership prevents us from negotiating our own comprehensive trade deals.
Now, I want Britain to be able to negotiate its own trade agreements. But I also want tariff-free trade with Europe and cross-border trade there to be as frictionless as possible.
That means I do not want Britain to be part of the Common Commercial Policy and I do not want us to be bound by the Common External Tariff. These are the elements of the Customs Union that prevent us from striking our own comprehensive trade agreements with other countries. But I do want us to have a customs agreement with the EU.
Whether that means we must reach a completely new customs agreement, become an associate member of the Customs Union in some way, or remain a signatory to some elements of it, I hold no preconceived position. I have an open mind on how we do it. It is not the means that matter, but the ends.
And those ends are clear: I want to remove as many barriers to trade as possible. And I want Britain to be free to establish our own tariff schedules at the World Trade Organisation, meaning we can reach new trade agreements not just with the European Union but with old friends and new allies from outside Europe too.
A Global Britain must also be a country that looks to the future. That means being one of the best places in the world for science and innovation.
One of our great strengths as a nation is the breadth and depth of our academic and scientific communities, backed up by some of the world's best universities. And we have a proud history of leading and supporting cutting-edge research and innovation.
So we will also welcome agreement to continue to collaborate with our European partners on major science, research, and technology initiatives.
From space exploration to clean energy to medical technologies, Britain will remain at the forefront of collective endeavours to better understand, and make better, the world in which we live.
And a Global Britain will continue to co-operate with its European partners in important areas such as crime, terrorism and foreign affairs.
All of us in Europe face the challenge of cross-border crime, a deadly terrorist threat, and the dangers presented by hostile states. All of us share interests and values in common, values we want to see projected around the world.
With the threats to our common security becoming more serious, our response cannot be to co-operate with one another less, but to work together more. I therefore want our future relationship with the European Union to include practical arrangements on matters of law enforcement and the sharing of intelligence material with our EU allies.
I am proud of the role Britain has played and will continue to play in promoting Europe's security. Britain has led Europe on the measures needed to keep our continent secure - whether it is implementing sanctions against Russia following its action in Crimea, working for peace and stability in the Balkans, or securing Europe's external border. We will continue to work closely with our European allies in foreign and defence policy even as we leave the EU itself.
These are our objectives for the negotiation ahead - objectives that will help to realise our ambition of shaping that stronger, fairer, Global Britain that we want to see.
They are the basis for a new, strong, constructive partnership with the European Union - a partnership of friends and allies, of interests and values. A partnership for a strong EU and a strong UK.
But there is one further objective we are setting. For as I have said before - it is in no one's interests for there to be a cliff-edge for business or a threat to stability, as we change from our existing relationship to a new partnership with the EU.
By this, I do not mean that we will seek some form of unlimited transitional status, in which we find ourselves stuck forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory. That would not be good for Britain, but nor do I believe it would be good for the EU.
Instead, I want us to have reached an agreement about our future partnership by the time the 2-year Article 50 process has concluded. From that point onwards, we believe a phased process of implementation, in which both Britain and the EU institutions and member states prepare for the new arrangements that will exist between us will be in our mutual self-interest. This will give businesses enough time to plan and prepare for those new arrangements.
This might be about our immigration controls, customs systems or the way in which we co-operate on criminal justice matters. Or it might be about the future legal and regulatory framework for financial services. For each issue, the time we need to phase-in the new arrangements may differ. Some might be introduced very quickly, some might take longer. And the interim arrangements we rely upon are likely to be a matter of negotiation.
But the purpose is clear: we will seek to avoid a disruptive cliff-edge, and we will do everything we can to phase in the new arrangements we require as Britain and the EU move towards our new partnership.
So, these are the objectives we have set. Certainty wherever possible. Control of our own laws. Strengthening the United Kingdom. Maintaining the Common Travel Area with Ireland. Control of immigration. Rights for EU nationals in Britain, and British nationals in the EU. Enhancing rights for workers. Free trade with European markets. New trade agreements with other countries. A leading role in science and innovation. Co-operation on crime, terrorism and foreign affairs. And a phased approach, delivering a smooth and orderly Brexit.
This is the framework of a deal that will herald a new partnership between the UK and the EU.
It is a comprehensive and carefully considered plan that focuses on the ends, not just the means - with its eyes fixed firmly on the future, and on the kind of country we will be once we leave.
It reflects the hard work of many in this room today who have worked tirelessly to bring it together and to prepare this country for the negotiation ahead.
And it will, I know, be debated and discussed at length. That is only right. But those who urge us to reveal more - such as the blow-by-blow details of our negotiating strategy, the areas in which we might compromise, the places where we think there are potential trade-offs - will not be acting in the national interest.
Because this is not a game or a time for opposition for opposition's sake. It is a crucial and sensitive negotiation that will define the interests and the success of our country for many years to come. And it is vital that we maintain our discipline.
That is why I have said before - and will continue to say - that every stray word and every hyped up media report is going to make it harder for us to get the right deal for Britain. Our opposite numbers in the European Commission know it, which is why they are keeping their discipline. And the ministers in this government know it too, which is why we will also maintain ours.
So however frustrating some people find it, the government will not be pressured into saying more than I believe it is in our national interest to say. Because it is not my job to fill column inches with daily updates, but to get the right deal for Britain. And that is what I intend to do.
I am confident that a deal - and a new strategic partnership between the UK and the EU - can be achieved.
This is firstly because, having held conversations with almost every leader from every single EU member state; having spent time talking to the senior figures from the European institutions, including President Tusk, President Juncker, and President Schulz; and after my Cabinet colleagues David Davis, Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson have done the same with their interlocutors, I am confident that the vast majority want a positive relationship between the UK and the EU after Brexit.
And I am confident that the objectives I am setting out today are consistent with the needs of the EU and its member states.
That is why our objectives include a proposed free trade agreement between Britain and the European Union, and explicitly rule out membership of the EU's single market. Because when the EU's leaders say they believe the 4 freedoms of the single market are indivisible, we respect that position. When the 27 member states say they want to continue their journey inside the European Union, we not only respect that fact but support it.
Because we do not want to undermine the single market, and we do not want to undermine the European Union. We want the EU to be a success and we want its remaining member states to prosper. And of course we want the same for Britain.
And the second reason I believe it is possible to reach a good deal is that the kind of agreement I have described today is the economically rational thing that both Britain and the EU should aim for. Because trade is not a zero sum game: more of it makes us all more prosperous. Free trade between Britain and the European Union means more trade, and more trade means more jobs and more wealth creation. The erection of new barriers to trade, meanwhile, means the reverse: less trade, fewer jobs, lower growth.
The third and final reason I believe we can come to the right agreement is that co-operation between Britain and the EU is needed not just when it comes to trade but when it comes to our security too.
Britain and France are Europe's only 2 nuclear powers. We are the only 2 European countries with permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Britain's armed forces are a crucial part of Europe's collective defence.
And our intelligence capabilities - unique in Europe - have already saved countless lives in very many terrorist plots that have been thwarted in countries across our continent. After Brexit, Britain wants to be a good friend and neighbour in every way, and that includes defending the safety and security of all of our citizens.
So I believe the framework I have outlined today is in Britain's interests. It is in Europe's interests. And it is in the interests of the wider world.
But I must be clear. Britain wants to remain a good friend and neighbour to Europe. Yet I know there are some voices calling for a punitive deal that punishes Britain and discourages other countries from taking the same path.
That would be an act of calamitous self-harm for the countries of Europe. And it would not be the act of a friend. Britain would not - indeed we could not - accept such an approach. And while I am confident that this scenario need never arise - while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached - I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.
Because we would still be able to trade with Europe. We would be free to strike trade deals across the world. And we would have the freedom to set the competitive tax rates and embrace the policies that would attract the world's best companies and biggest investors to Britain. And - if we were excluded from accessing the single market - we would be free to change the basis of Britain's economic model.
But for the EU, it would mean new barriers to trade with one of the biggest economies in the world. It would jeopardise investments in Britain by EU companies worth more than half a trillion pounds. It would mean a loss of access for European firms to the financial services of the City of London. It would risk exports from the EU to Britain worth around £290 billion every year. And it would disrupt the sophisticated and integrated supply chains upon which many EU companies rely.
Important sectors of the EU economy would also suffer. We are a crucial - profitable - export market for Europe's automotive industry, as well as sectors including energy, food and drink, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. These sectors employ millions of people around Europe. And I do not believe that the EU's leaders will seriously tell German exporters, French farmers, Spanish fishermen, the young unemployed of the Eurozone, and millions of others, that they want to make them poorer, just to punish Britain and make a political point.
For all these reasons - and because of our shared values and the spirit of goodwill that exists on both sides - I am confident that we will follow a better path. I am confident that a positive agreement can be reached. It is right that the government should prepare for every eventuality - but to do so in the knowledge that a constructive and optimistic approach to the negotiations to come is in the best interests of Europe and the best interests of Britain.
We do not approach these negotiations expecting failure, but anticipating success.
Because we are a great, global nation with so much to offer Europe and so much to offer the world.
One of the world's largest and strongest economies. With the finest intelligence services, the bravest armed forces, the most effective hard and soft power, and friendships, partnerships and alliances in every continent.
And another thing that's important. The essential ingredient of our success. The strength and support of 65 million people willing us to make it happen.
Because after all the division and discord, the country is coming together.
The referendum was divisive at times. And those divisions have taken time to heal.
But one of the reasons that Britain's democracy has been such a success for so many years is that the strength of our identity as one nation, the respect we show to one another as fellow citizens, and the importance we attach to our institutions means that when a vote has been held we all respect the result. The victors have the responsibility to act magnanimously. The losers have the responsibility to respect the legitimacy of the outcome. And the country comes together.
And that is what we are seeing today. Business isn't calling to reverse the result, but planning to make a success of it. The House of Commons has voted overwhelmingly for us to get on with it. And the overwhelming majority of people - however they voted - want us to get on with it too.
So that is what we will do.
Not merely forming a new partnership with Europe, but building a stronger, fairer, more Global Britain too.
And let that be the legacy of our time. The prize towards which we work. The destination at which we arrive once the negotiation is done.
And let us do it not for ourselves, but for those who follow. For the country's children and grandchildren too.
So that when future generations look back at this time, they will judge us not only by the decision that we made, but by what we made of that decision.
They will see that we shaped them a brighter future.
They will know that we built them a better Britain.",0.8433290719985962,0.0,0.0,0.1565999835729599,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

Helping young people buy their own home.
Getting the long-term unemployed back to work.
Freezing fuel duty.
Backing marriage.
Cutting the deficit.
Creating jobs.
Creating wealth.
Make no mistake: it is this Party with the verve, energy and ideas to take our country forward.
And I want to thank everyone here for the great week we've had.
When we came to office, we faced a clear and daunting task: to turn our country around.
In May 2010, the needle on the gauge was at crisis point.
People were talking about this country in a way they had not done for decades.
But three and a half years later, we are beginning to turn the corner.
The deficit is falling.
Our economy is growing.
The numbers of our fellow countrymen and women in work are rising.
We are not there yet, not by a long way.
But, my friends, we are on our way.
I want to thank the people who have done the most to get us this far.
You. The British people.
Never giving up. Working those extra hours. Coping with those necessary cuts.
You. British business. You kept people on in the hard times. Invested before you knew for certain that things were getting better.
Together - we are clearing up the mess that Labour left.
But I have a simple question, to the people in this hall and beyond it.
Is that enough?
Is it enough that we just clear up Labour's mess and think 'job done'?
Is it enough to just fix what went wrong?
I say - no. Not for me.
This isn't job done; it is job begun.
I didn't come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right.
We in this party - we don't dream of deficits and decimal points and dry fiscal plans.
Our dreams are about helping people get on in life.
Aspiration, opportunity: these are our words, our dreams.
So today I want to talk about our one, abiding mission.
I believe it is the great Conservative mission.
That as our economy starts to recover, we build a land of opportunity in our country today.
Now, I know, it'll be tough.
But I know we've got what it takes in this Party.
Some people say ""can't be done"" - Conservatives say ""what's to stop us?""
They said we couldn't get terrorists out of our own country.
Well - Theresa knew otherwise......and that's why Abu Qatada had his very own May Day this year...
Didn't it feel good seeing him get on that plane?
Some people said the NHS wasn't safe in our hands.
Well - we knew otherwise.
Who protected spending on the NHS? Not Labour - us.
Who started the Cancer Drugs Fund? Not Labour - us.
And by the way - who presided over Mid Staffs?
Patients left for so long without water, they were drinking out of dirty vases......people's grandparents lying filthy and unwashed for days.
Who allowed that to happen? Yes, it was Labour......and don't you dare lecture anyone on the NHS again.
And some people say a lot of things on Europe.
You'll never be able to veto an EU treaty.
You'll never cut the Budget.
And if you did these things - you'd have no allies in Europe.
Well we've proved them wrong.
I vetoed that treaty.
I got Britain out of the EU bail-out scheme.
And yes - I cut that budget.
And in doing all this, we haven't lost respect - we've won allies to get powers back from Europe.
That is what we will do......and at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum.
That is our pledge. It will be your choice: in or out.
And friends, you know what someone said about us recently?
Apparently some Russian official said: Britain is ""just a small island that no-one pays any attention to.""
Really?
Let me just get this off my chest.
When the world wanted rights, who wrote Magna Carta?
When they wanted representation, who built the first Parliament?
When they looked for compassion, who led the abolition of slavery?
When they searched for equality, who gave women the vote?
When their freedom was in peril, who offered blood, toil, tears and sweat?
And today - whose music do they dance to?
Whose universities do they flock to?
Whose football league do they watch?
Whose example of tolerance of people living together from every nation, every religion, young and old, straight and gay?
Whose example do they aspire to?
I haven't even got on to the fact that this small island beat Russia in the Olympics last year, or that the biggest-selling vodka brand in the world isn't Russian, it's British - Smirnoff - made in Fife....so yes, we may be a small island
but I tell you what, we're a great country.
But I want to make a serious point about our place in the world.
Following that vote on Syria in the House of Commons, some people said it was time for Britain to re-think our role.
I'm sorry - but I don't agree.
If we shrunk from the world we would be less safe and less prosperous.
The role we play, the organisations we belong to...... and yes - the fact our defence budget remains the 4th largest in the world......all this is not about national vanity - it's about our national interest.
When British citizens -our fathers, mothers, daughters- are in danger......whether that's in the deserts of Algeria or the city of Nairobi
then combatting international terrorism - it matters to us.
When five of the world's fastest growing economies are African,
then trading with Africa - and yes helping Africa to develop with aid - that matters to us.
And at the heart of all this work - the finest Foreign Secretary I could ask for: William Hague.
Around the world, we really do matter as a United Kingdom:
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
The date of the referendum has been set. The decision is for Scotland to make.
All the arguments about our economy, jobs, currency - I believe they make an unanswerable case for the UK.
But today I want a more simple message to go out to all the people of Scotland.
From us here in this hall, from me, from this party, from this country, from England, Wales, Northern Ireland
and it's this:
We want you to stay.
We want to stick together.
Think of all we've achieved together - the things we can do together.
The nations - as one.
Our Kingdom - United.
For 12 years now, men and women from all parts of these islands have been serving their country in Afghanistan.
Next year, the last of our combat troops will be coming home......having trained up the Afghans to look after their own country.
More than a decade of war.
Sacrifice beyond measure - from the finest and bravest armed forces in the world.
And I want us to stand, to raise the roof in here, to show just how proud of those men and women we are.
We in this room are a team.
And this year, we said goodbye to one of our team.
Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad.
Rescuing our economy. Giving power to our people. Spreading home ownership. Creating work. Winning the Cold War. Saving the Falklands.
I asked her about her record once.
I was sitting next to her at a dinner - and I was really nervous.
As ever she was totally charming, she put me at ease......but after a while I said: ""Margaret, if you had your time in Government again, is there anything you'd do differently?""
And she turned to me and said: ""You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around.""
Well we can all agree with that - and we can all agree on this......she was the greatest peace-time Prime Minister our country has ever had.
Margaret Thatcher had an almighty mess to clear up when she came to office
and so did we.
We will never forget what we found.
The biggest Budget deficit in our peace-time history.
The deepest recession since the Second World War.
But it wasn't just the debt and deficit Labour left,
it was who got hurt.
Millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare.
The richest paying lower tax rates than their cleaners.
Unsustainable, debt-fuelled banks booming - while manufacturing withered away.
The North falling further behind.
Towns where a quarter of people lived on benefits.
Schools where 8 out of 10 children didn't get five decent GCSEs.
Yes, they were famously ""intensely relaxed"" about people getting filthy rich....but tragically, they were also ""intensely relaxed"" about people staying stuck on welfare year after year...
""intensely relaxed"" about children leaving school without proper qualifications so they couldn't hope to get a job at the end of it.
That was it.
That was what they left.
The casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system...
a country for the few built by the so-called party of the many.
and Labour: we will never let you forget it.
These past few years have been a real struggle.
But what people want to know now is: was the struggle worth it?
And here's the honest answer.
The struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we've started.
Finishing the job means understanding this.
Our economy may be turning the corner - and of course that's great.
But we still haven't finished paying for Labour's Debt Crisis.
If anyone thinks that's over, done, dealt with - they're living in a fantasy land.
This country's debt crisis, created by Labour, is not over.
After three years of cuts, we still have one of the biggest deficits in the world.
We are still spending more than we earn.
We still need to earn more and yes, our Government still needs to spend less.
I see that Labour have stopped talking about the debt crisis and now they talk about the cost of living crisis.
As if one wasn't directly related to the other.
If you want to know what happens if you don't deal with a debt crisis.....and how it affects the cost of living......just go and ask the Greeks.
So finishing the job means sticking to our course until we've paid off all of Labour's deficit, not just some of it.
And yes - let's run a surplus so that this time we fix the roof when the sun is shining......as George said in that brilliant speech on Monday.
To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away all the progress we've made.
It would put us back to square one.
Unbelievably, that's exactly what Labour now want to do.
How did they get us into this mess?
Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt.
And what did they propose last week?
More spending, more borrowing, more debt.
They have learned nothing - literally nothing - from the crisis they created.
But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left.
It means building something better in its place.
In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on.
In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off.
In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed.
Our economy, our society, welfare, schools....all reformed, all rebuilt - with one aim, one mission in mind:
To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all.
For all.
So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you're black or you're white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were....what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you'll have the chance to make it.
That's what the land of opportunity means.
That's what finishing the job means.
Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things.
But wishing for something, caring about something - that's not enough.
You can't conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister's pen.
It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and - above all - the right values.
When the left say: you can't expect too much from the poorest kids; don't ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution.
Here in this party we say: that's just wrong.
If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them.
Yes, you must help people - but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts.
You don't help children succeed by dumbing down education....you help them by pushing them hard.
Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child.
You don't help people by leaving them stuck on welfare....but by helping them stand on their own two feet.
Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work - and the dignity that brings
We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise......these are not dirty, elitist words - they're not the problem......they really are the solution because it's not government that creates jobs, it's businesses.
it's businesses that get wages in people's pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country.
There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity. No quick fix. No easy way to do it.
You build it business by business, school by school, person by person....patiently, practically, painstakingly.
And underpinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed.
This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state.
It's how we've been clearing up the mess.
And it's how we're going to build something better in its place.
So let's stick with it and finish the job we've started.
A land of opportunity starts in our economy.
The chance to get a decent job. To start a business. To own a home.
And at the end of it all - more money in your pocket.
To get decent jobs for people, you've got to recognise some fundamental economic facts.
We are in a global race today. No one owes us a living.
Last week, our ambition to compete in the global race was airily dismissed as a race to the bottom......that it means competing with China on sweatshops and India on low wages.
No - those countries are becoming our customers.
and we've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology.
And here's something else you need to recognise about this race.
The plain fact is this.
All those global companies that employ lots of people - they can set up anywhere in the world.
They could go to Silicon Valley. To Berlin.
And yes, here in Manchester.
And these companies base their decisions on some simple things: like the tax rates in each country.
So if those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here.
And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs.
Do you get that, Labour?
British people don't get those jobs.
Last week Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers.
That is just about the most damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy you could possibly come up with.
I get to visit some amazing factories in my job.
One of my favourites is Jaguar Land Rover......not just because they actually let me get in a car and drive it around on my own......but really because I get to meet people there who are incredibly proud of their work and their craftsmanship......the fact that what they're making sells around the world - the best of British design and engineering.
So when Ed Miliband talks about the face of big business, I think about the faces of these hardworking people.
Labour is saying to their employers: ""we want to put up your taxes. don't come here - stick your jobs and take them elsewhere"".
I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience.
But it's crazy for our country.
So if Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business - ours is to back business.
Regulation - down. Taxes - cut for businesses large and small. A new industrial policy that looks to the future - green jobs, aerospace jobs, life science jobs.
We've made a good start: 1.4 million new jobs created in our private sector since we came to office......and that is 1.4 million reasons to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity, it's easier to start your own business.
To all those people who strike out on their own, who sit there night after night......checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up......I say I have so much respect for you - you are national heroes.
I'll never forget watching Samantha do just that - winning her first customer, sorting out the cash flow, that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed.
I was incredibly proud of her then - and I am incredibly proud of her now.
People setting up new businesses need finance - that's why we've brought in Start-up Loans.
They need their taxes cut - and we're doing it - up to £2000 off your National Insurance bill for every small business
And it's working.
Let me tell you how many businesses have started up in Britain since the election: over 300,000.
That is 300,000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity, more people must be able to own a home of their own.
You know that old saying, your home is your castle?
Well for most young people today, their home is their landlord's.
Generation Y is starting to become Generation Why Do We Bother?
Millions of them stuck renting when they're desperate to buy.
I met a couple on Sunday - Emily and James.
They'd both had decent jobs, but because they didn't have rich parents, they couldn't get a big enough deposit to buy a house.
And let me tell you where I met them.
In their new home, bought with our Help to Buy mortgage scheme.
It was still half built. but they showed me where the kitchen would be.
Outside there was rubble all over the ground, but they'd already bought a lawn-mower.
And they talked about how excited they were to be spending a first Christmas in a home of their own.
That is what we're about.
And this, the party of aspiration is going to finish the job we've started.
In a land of opportunity there's another thing people need.
the most important thing of all.
more money in their pockets.
These have been difficult years.
People have found it hard to make ends meet.
That's why we've frozen council tax.
and why we are freezing fuel duty.
But we need to do more. I know that.
We've heard Labour's ideas to help with the cost of living.
Taxes on banks they want to spend ten times over.
Promising free childcare - then saying that actually, you've got to pay for it.
An energy promise they admitted 24 hours later they might not be able to keep.
It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes... cobbled together for the TV cameras.
Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy.
To raise living standards in the long-term, you need to do some major things:......you need to cut the deficit to keep mortgage rates low......you need to grow your economy, get people jobs......and yes - cut people's taxes.
I want people to keep more of their money.
We've already cut the taxes of 25 million hardworking people......and yes - that is 25 million more reasons to finish the job we've started.
We're Tories. We believe in low taxes. And believe me - we will keep on cutting the taxes of hardworking people.
And here in Manchester let me say this: when I say a land of opportunity for all I mean everyone - North and South.
This country has been too London-centric for far too long.
That's why we need a new North-South railway line.
The fact is this.
The West Coast mainline is almost full.
We have to build a new railway.
and the choice is between another old-style Victorian one - or a high speed one.
Just imagine if someone had said, no, we can't build the M1, or the Severn Bridge, imagine how that would be hobbling our economy today.
HS2 is about bringing North and South together in our national endeavour.
Because think of what more we could do with the pistons firing in all parts of our country.
With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy.
With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry.
With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials.
We're building an economy for the North and South, embracing new technologies, producing things and selling them to the world.
So make no mistake who's looking forward in British politics......we'll leave the 1970s-style socialism to others......we are the party of the future.
We're making progress.
You know how I know that?
It's every week, at Prime Minister's Questions.
There was a time when I'd look across to Ed Balls, and there he was, shouting his head off, and doing this with his hands - screaming out the economy was flat-lining..and all with such glee.
But recently, it's gone a bit quiet.
Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy's now growing?
Well, I've got a gesture of my own for Ed Balls....and don't worry - it's not a rude one....jobs are up..construction is up....manufacturing is up....inward investment..retail sales..homebuilding....business confidence..consumer confidence - all these things are up.
And to anyone who wants to talk our economy down, let me tell you this.
Since this conference began, over 100,000 jet planes have soared into the sky on wings made in Britain.
Every single day in this country, over 4,000 cars are coming off the production line - ready to be exported around the globe.
Last year, Britain overtook France as Germany's top trading partner......not bad for a nation of shop-keepers.
And that's the point.
Exports to China are up.
Exports to Brazil are up..exports to India, Russia, Thailand, South Korea, Australia - all up.
So let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics...
Yes - the oceans can rise..and empires can fall..but one thing will never, ever change..it's Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up.
A land of opportunity means educating our children - and I mean all our children.
It's OK for the children who have parents reading them stories every night - and that's great..but what about the ones at the back of the class, in the chaotic home, in the home of the drug addict or alcoholic?
We need these children - and frankly they need us.
That's why three and a half years ago, one man came into the Department of Education....Michael Gove, there he is......with a belief in excellence and massive energy......like a cross between Mr Chips and the Duracell bunny.
Let's look at the results.
More students studying proper science.
More children learning a foreign language.
We've ended the dumbing down in exams.
For the first time - children in our schools will learn the new language of computer coding.
And we're sending a clear message to children: if you fail English and maths GCSE, you're going to have to take and re-take them again until you pass.
Because as I tell my own children - there's not a job in the world where you don't need to spell and add up properly.
But ultimately - really raising standards means innovation, choice..it means giving passionate people the freedom to run our schools.
That's what Free Schools are all about.
I'll never forget sitting in the classroom at Perry Beeches III in Birmingham, on the first day of term this year.
I met a mum there who said to me - this is what I've dreamed of for my child......proper uniforms, high standards......this is going to give my child a good start in life.
When Michael Howard asked me what job I wanted in the Shadow cabinet I said education......because this is the kind of thing I came into politics to bring about.
You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools?
Labour's official policy is to be against them......but - get this - Labour MPs are backing them in their local area.
And not just any Labour MPs.
I promise I'm not making this up.....the Shadow Education Secretary - Stephen Twigg - has backed one in his own city.
Unbelievable.
And isn't that always the way with the Left?
They don't like privilege - unless of course it's for their own children.
Well we in this Party are ambitious for all our children......and we've got to finish the job we started.
We've already got technical colleges run by great companies like JCB......I say: let's have one of those colleges in every single major town.
We've had a million apprenticeships start with this Government......now we want a new expectation: as you leave school you have a choice - go to university or do an apprenticeship.
And while we've still got children leaving primary school not reading, writing and adding up properly......let us set this ambition for our country: let's eliminate illiteracy and give every one of those children a chance.
And friends as we do all this, we're remembering the most vulnerable children of all.
There are thousands of children every year who grow up in homes where nappies - and bedclothes - go unchanged......and where their cries of pain go unheard.
These children just need the most basic opportunity of all: a loving family.
Two years ago I told you about our determination to speed up adoption......and this past year, we saw record numbers finding permanent, loving homes.
4000 children adopted......that is 4000 more reasons to finish the job we've started.
And as we keep on with this, we remember who is on the front line.
I have to make some tough decisions in my job......but none as tough as whether to break up a family and rescue a child... or try and stitch that family back together.
Social work is a noble and vital calling.
I'll never forget how after my son Ivan was born, a social worker sat patiently in our kitchen and told us about the sort of help we might need.
This Government has helped get some of the brightest graduates into teaching......and we have pledged to do the same for social work......now let us, in this hall, hear it for Britain's social workers who are doing such an important job in our country today.
The land of opportunity needs one final thing: welfare that works.
We know how badly things went wrong.
Our fellow citizens working every hour of every day to put food on the table ask this: why should my taxes go to people who could work but don't?
Or to those who live in homes that hardworking people could never afford?
Or to people who have no right to be here in the first place?
I say this to the British people: you have every right to be angry about a system that is unfair and unjust - and that's why we are sorting it out.
We've capped welfare. We've capped housing benefit. We've insisted on new rules so that if you reject work, you lose benefits.
And let's be absolutely clear.
As Boris said in that great speech yesterday, the problems in our welfare system and the problems in our immigration system are inextricably linked.
If we don't get our people back to work - we shouldn't be surprised if millions want to come here to work.
But we must act on immigration directly too - and we are.
Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges.
And when the Immigration Bill comes before Parliament, we will make sure some simple and fair things, that should have always been the case, are now set in stone.
If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it.
If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house. Not off the council, not off anyone else.
When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills.
If you appeal - you must do it from your own country, after you've been deported, not from here.
And on these huge, national problems we are making progress.
Immigration has come down.
On welfare: not only are there more people in work than ever before..the number of households where no one works is at its lowest rate since records began..and I want to thank the most determined champion for social justice this Party has ever had: Iain Duncan Smith.
Iain understands that this isn't about fixing systems, it's about saving lives..and that's why we've got to finish the job we've started.
There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training.
Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits.
It's time for bold action here.
We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all.
Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice:
Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job.
But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that.
And let no one paint ideas like this as callous.
Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing?
No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way. and so must we.
So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning.
And you know - on this, as on everything else, Labour will fight us....but remember: we are giving people real opportunities.
I've had people say to me ""I'm back on my feet""... ""I feel worthwhile.""
One wrote to me saying: now I can tell my son his Dad really does something.
This is what our Party is all about.
We don't patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head.
We look people in the eye as equals and say: yes, you've been down - but you're not out..you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance.
And that's why we can say today that it's this Party that is fighting for all those who were written off by Labour....it's this Party that's for the many not the few..Yes - the land of despair was Labour....but the land of hope is Tory.
We have done some big things to transform Britain.
But we need to finish the job we've started.
We need to go further, do more for hardworking people......give more children a chance, back more businesses, help create more jobs.
And I'm clear about how that job will best get done.
It requires a strong Government, with a clear mandate, that is accountable for what it promises and yes, what it delivers.
And let me tell everyone here what that means.
When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition......we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative Government - because that is what our country needs.
You don't do this job to be popular.
You do it because you love your country.
I do the best I can. And for me, it comes back to some simple things.
Country first. Do what's decent. Think long-term.
There's an old story that's told about a great hall in Oxford, near my constituency.
For hundreds of years it's stood there - held up with vast oak beams.
In the 19th century, those beams needed replacing.
And you know what they found?
500 years before, someone had thought. those beams will need replacing one day..so they planted some oak trees.
Just think about that.
Centuries had passed. Columbus had reached America. Gravity had been discovered..and when those oaks were needed, they were ready.
Margaret Thatcher once said: ""We are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all.""
That is what we are doing today.
Not just making do and mending..but making something better.
Since I got to my feet, almost a hundred children have been born across this country.
Children of wealth - and children of none.
Children of parents in work - and children of parents out of work.
For every single one of those new-born babies let us pledge today that we will build something better..a land of opportunity.
A country built on that enduring principle, seared in our hearts, that if you work hard, save, play by the rules and do your fair share - then nothing should stand in your way.
A new economy.
A new welfare system.
A new set of values in our schools.
Not just fixing the mess we inherited - but building something better.
We've got a year and a half 'til that election....a year and a half until Britain makes a choice: move forward to something better or go back to something worse..but I believe that if this party fights with all we have, then this country will make the right choice.
Because we always have before.
Whenever we've had the choice of giving in to some shabby compromise or pushing forward to something better we've said: this is Great Britain..the improbable hero of history..the country that doesn't give in, that doesn't give up..that knows there's no such thing as destiny - only our determination to succeed.
So I look to our future and I'm confident.
There are battles to fight but beyond this hall are the millions of hardworking people who renew the great in Great Britain every day..in the way they work and the way they give and raise their families.
These are the people we have alongside us....together we've made it this far......together we'll finish the job we've started....together we'll build that land of opportunity.",0.0,0.0,0.9999037981033325,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream

Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do.
Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are.
Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about.
But I know there's another big question people want me to answer.
What's my vision for Britain? My philosophy? My approach?
Today I want to answer that question very directly.
I want to set out my vision for Britain after Brexit.
I want to lay out my approach - the things I believe.
I want to explain what a country that works for everyone means.
I want to set our party and our country on the path towards the new centre ground of British politics...
built on the values of fairness and opportunity...
where everyone plays by the same rules and where every single person - regardless of their background, or that of their parents - is given the chance to be all they want to be.
And as I do so, I want to be clear about something else: that a vision is nothing without the determination to see it through.
No vision ever built a business by itself. No vision ever clothed a family or fed a hungry child. No vision ever changed a country on its own.
You need to put the hours in and the effort too.
But if you do, great things can happen. Great changes can occur.
And be in no doubt, that's what Britain needs today.
Because in June people voted for change. And a change is going to come.
Change has got to come because as we leave the European Union and take control of our own destiny, the task of tackling some of Britain's long-standing challenges - like how to train enough people to do the jobs of the future - becomes ever more urgent.
But change has got to come too because of the quiet revolution that took place in our country just three months ago - a revolution in which millions of our fellow citizens stood up and said they were not prepared to be ignored anymore.
Because this is a turning point for our country.
A once-in-a-generation chance to change the direction of our nation for good.
To step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be.
Let's be clear: we have come a long way over the past six years.
We've brought the deficit down.
Got more people into work than ever before.
Taken the lowest paid out of income tax.
Established a new National Living Wage.
Helped nearly a million new business to set up and grow.
Got almost one and a half million more children into good or outstanding schools.
Put record investment into the NHS.
Created nearly 3 million new apprenticeships.
And brought crime down by more than a quarter to its lowest ever level.
That's a record of which we should all be proud.
And this morning it's right that we pause to say thank you to the man who made that possible. A man who challenged us to change and told us that if we did then we would win again.
And he was right. We did change. We did win. The first majority Conservative Government in almost 25 years.
A great leader of our party - a great servant to our country.
David Cameron, thank you.
But now we need to change again. For the referendum was not just a vote to withdraw from the EU. It was about something broader - something that the European Union had come to represent.
It was about a sense - deep, profound and let's face it often justified - that many people have today that the world works well for a privileged few, but not for them.
It was a vote not just to change Britain's relationship with the European Union, but to call for a change in the way our country works - and the people for whom it works - forever.
Knock on almost any door in almost any part of the country, and you will find the roots of the revolution laid bare.
Our society should work for everyone, but if you can't afford to get onto the property ladder, or your child is stuck in a bad school, it doesn't feel like it's working for you.
Our economy should work for everyone, but if your pay has stagnated for several years in a row and fixed items of spending keep going up, it doesn't feel like it's working for you.
Our democracy should work for everyone, but if you've been trying to say things need to change for years and your complaints fall on deaf ears, it doesn't feel like it's working for you.
And the roots of the revolution run deep. Because it wasn't the wealthy who made the biggest sacrifices after the financial crash, but ordinary, working class families.
And if you're one of those people who lost their job, who stayed in work but on reduced hours, took a pay cut as household bills rocketed, or - and I know a lot of people don't like to admit this - someone who finds themselves out of work or on lower wages because of low-skilled immigration, life simply doesn't seem fair.
It feels like your dreams have been sacrificed in the service of others.
So change has got to come.
Because if we don't respond - if we don't take this opportunity to deliver the change people want - resentments will grow. Divisions will become entrenched.
And that would be a disaster for Britain.
Because the lesson of Britain is that we are a country built on the bonds of family, community, citizenship.
Of strong institutions and a strong society.
The country of my parents who instilled in me a sense of public service and of public servants everywhere who want to give something back.
The parent who works hard all week but takes time out to coach the kids football team at the weekend.
The local family business in my constituency that's been serving the community for more than 50 years.
The servicemen and women I met last week who wear their uniform proudly at home and serve our nation with honour abroad.
A country of decency, fairness and quiet resolve.
And a successful country - small in size but large in stature - that with less than 1% of the world's population boasts more Nobel Laureates than any country outside the United States... with three more added again just yesterday - two of whom worked here in this great city.
A country that boasts three of the top ten universities in the world. The world's leading financial capital. And institutions like the NHS and BBC whose reputations echo in some of the farthest corners of the globe.
All possible because we are one United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - and I will always fight to preserve our proud, historic Union and will never let divisive nationalists drive us apart.
Yet within our society today, we see division and unfairness all around. Between a more prosperous older generation and a struggling younger generation. Between the wealth of London and the rest of the country.
But perhaps most of all, between the rich, the successful and the powerful - and their fellow citizens.
Now don't get me wrong. We applaud success. We want people to get on.
But we also value something else: the spirit of citizenship.
That spirit that means you respect the bonds and obligations that make our society work. That means a commitment to the men and women who live around you, who work for you, who buy the goods and services you sell.
That spirit that means recognising the social contract that says you train up local young people before you take on cheap labour from overseas.
That spirit that means you do as others do, and pay your fair share of tax.
But today, too many people in positions of power behave as though they have more in common with international elites than with the people down the road, the people they employ, the people they pass in the street.
But if you believe you're a citizen of the world, you're a citizen of nowhere. You don't understand what the very word 'citizenship' means.
So if you're a boss who earns a fortune but doesn't look after your staff...
An international company that treats tax laws as an optional extra...
A household name that refuses to work with the authorities even to fight terrorism...
A director who takes out massive dividends while knowing that the company pension is about to go bust...
I'm putting you on warning. This can't go on anymore.
A change has got to come. And this party - the Conservative Party - is going to make that change.
So today, I want to set out my plan for a Britain where everyone plays by the same rules and every person has the opportunity to be all they want to be.
It's a plan to tackle the unfairness and injustice that divides us, so that we may build a new united Britain, rooted in the centre ground.
A plan that will mean government stepping up. Righting wrongs. Challenging vested interests. Taking big decisions. Doing what we believe to be right. Getting the job done.
Because that's the good that government can do. And it's what I'm in this for. To stand up for the weak and stand up to the strong.
And to put the power of government squarely at the service of ordinary working-class people.
Because too often that isn't how it works today.
Just listen to the way a lot of politicians and commentators talk about the public.
They find your patriotism distasteful, your concerns about immigration parochial, your views about crime illiberal, your attachment to your job security inconvenient.
They find the fact that more than seventeen million voters decided to leave the European Union simply bewildering.
Because if you're well off and comfortable, Britain is a different country and these concerns are not your concerns. It's easy to dismiss them - easy to say that all you want from government is for it to get out of the way.
But a change has got to come. It's time to remember the good that government can do.
Time for a new approach that says while government does not have all the answers, government can and should be a force for good;
that the state exists to provide what individual people, communities and markets cannot;
and that we should employ the power of government for the good of the people.
Time to reject the ideological templates provided by the socialist left and the libertarian right and to embrace a new centre ground in which government steps up - and not back - to act on behalf of us all.
Providing security from crime, but from ill health and unemployment too.
Supporting free markets, but stepping in to repair them when they aren't working as they should.
Encouraging business and supporting free trade, but not accepting one set of rules for some and another for everyone else.
And if we do - if we act to correct unfairness and injustice and put government at the service of ordinary working people - we can build that new united Britain in which everyone plays by the same rules, and in which the powerful and the privileged no longer ignore the interests of the people.
Only we can do it. Because the main lesson I take from their conference last week is that the Labour Party is not just divided, but divisive.
Determined to pit one against another. To pursue vendettas and settle scores. And to embrace the politics of pointless protest that simply pulls people further apart.
That's what Labour stands for today. Fighting among themselves. Abusing their own MPs. Threatening to end their careers. Tolerating anti-Semitism and supporting voices of hate.
You know what some people call them?
The nasty party.
And with Labour divided, divisive and out-of-touch, we have a responsibility to step up, represent and govern for the whole nation.
So where Labour build barriers, we will build bridges.
That means tackling unfairness and injustice, and shifting the balance of Britain decisively in favour of ordinary working class people.
Giving them access to the opportunities that are too often the preserve of the privileged few.
Putting fairness at the heart of our agenda and creating a country in which hard work is rewarded and talent is welcome.
A nation where contribution matters more than entitlement. Merit matters more than wealth.
A confident global Britain that doesn't turn its back on globalisation but ensures the benefits are shared by all.
A country that is prosperous and secure, so every person may share in the wealth of the nation and live their life free from fear.
That's what I mean by a country that works for everyone.
And if we believe in the good that government can do, it's important for people to trust us to deliver the change they need.
We can start - as I said on Sunday - by doing something obvious. And that is to stop quibbling, respect what the people told us on the 23rd of June - and take Britain out of the European Union.
Because it took that typically British quiet resolve for people to go out and vote as they did: to defy the establishment, to ignore the threats, to make their voice heard.
So let us have that same resolve now.
And let's be clear about what is going to happen.
Article Fifty - triggered no later than the end of March.
A Great Repeal Bill to get rid of the European Communities Act - introduced in the next Parliamentary session.
Our laws made not in Brussels but in Westminster.
Our judges sitting not in Luxembourg but in courts across the land.
The authority of EU law in this country ended forever.
The people told us they wanted these things - and this Conservative Government is going to deliver them.
It is, of course, too early to say exactly what agreement we will reach with the EU. It's going to be a tough negotiation, it will require some give and take. And while there will always be pressure to give a running commentary, it will not be in our national interest to do so.
But let me be clear about the agreement we seek.
I want it to reflect the strong and mature relationships we enjoy with our European friends.
I want it to include cooperation on law enforcement and counter-terrorism work.
I want it to involve free trade, in goods and services.
I want it to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate within the Single Market - and let European businesses do the same here.
But let's state one thing loud and clear: we are not leaving the European Union only to give up control of immigration all over again. And we are not leaving only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That's not going to happen.
We are leaving to become, once more, a fully sovereign and independent country - and the deal is going to have to work for Britain.
And that Britain - the Britain we build after Brexit - is going to be a Global Britain.
Because while we are leaving the European Union, we will not leave the continent of Europe. We will not abandon our friends and allies abroad. And we will not retreat from the world.
In fact, now is the time to forge a bold, new, confident role for ourselves on the world stage.
Keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world.
Providing humanitarian support for refugees in need.
Taking the lead on cracking down on modern slavery wherever it is found.
Ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Always acting as the strongest and most passionate advocate for free trade right across the globe.
And always committed to a strong national defence and supporting the finest Armed Forces known to man.
And this week, our excellent Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, proved not only that we will support them with our hearts and souls. Not only will we remain committed to spending two per cent of our national income on defence.
But we will never again - in any future conflict - let those activist, left-wing human rights lawyers harangue and harass the bravest of the brave - the men and women of Britain's Armed Forces.
It's about restoring fairness - something that must be at the heart of everything we do. Supporting those who do the right thing, who make a contribution.
Helping those who give something back.
And that's at the heart of my plan for our economy too.
An economy that's fair and where everyone plays by the same rules.
That means acting to tackle some of the economy's structural problems that hold people back.
Things like the shortage of affordable homes. The need to make big decisions on - and invest in - our infrastructure. The need to rebalance the economy across sectors and areas in order to spread wealth and prosperity around the country.
Politicians have talked about this for years. But the trouble is that this kind of change will never just happen by itself. If that's what we want, we need the vision and determination to see it through.
That's why Philip Hammond and Greg Clark are working on a new industrial strategy to address those long-term structural challenges and get Britain firing on all cylinders again.
It's not about picking winners, propping up failing industries, or bringing old companies back from the dead.
It's about identifying the industries that are of strategic value to our economy and supporting and promoting them through policies on trade, tax, infrastructure, skills, training, and research and development.
It's about doing what every other major and growing economy in the world does.
Not just sitting back and seeing what happens - but putting in place a plan and getting on with the job.
So we will identify the sectors of the economy - financial services, yes, but life sciences, tech, aerospace, car manufacturing, the creative industries and many others - that are of strategic importance to our economy, and do everything we can to encourage, develop and support them.
And we will identify the places that have the potential to contribute to economic growth and become the homes to millions of new jobs.
That means inspiring an economic and cultural revival of all of our great regional cities.
We have made a start.
Thanks to George Osborne's Northern Powerhouse, over the past year, foreign direct investment in the North has increased at double the rate of the rest of the country.
Here in Birmingham, thanks to the incredible Jaguar Land Rover, the West Midlands is the only part of the country to run a trade surplus with China.
And across the region, the Midlands Engine is on track to deliver 300,000 more jobs by 2020.
Now it's time to build on that success - in Birmingham and Manchester and in other cities across the country.
And as we are here in Birmingham this week, let us show our support for the Conservative Party's candidate for next year's mayoral election.
A success in business running John Lewis. An action man in Birmingham, playing his part in transforming this city. A man to get things done, the future Mayor of the West Midlands - Andy Street.
An economy that works for everyone is an economy where everyone plays by the same rules.
I understand the frustration people feel when they see the rich and the powerful getting away with things that they themselves wouldn't dream of doing. And they wouldn't get away with if they tried.
I understand that because I feel it too.
There's always an excuse - a reason why something can't be done - but when that is used as a basis for inaction, faith in capitalism and free markets falls.
The Conservative Party will always believe in free markets. And that's precisely why it's this party that should act to defend them.
From Edmund Burke onwards, Conservatives have always understood that if you want to preserve something important, you need to be prepared to reform it. We must apply that same approach today.
That's why where markets are dysfunctional, we should be prepared to intervene.
Where companies are exploiting the failures of the market in which they operate, where consumer choice is inhibited by deliberately complex pricing structures, we must set the market right.
It's just not right, for example, that half of people living in rural areas, and so many small businesses, can't get a decent broadband connection.
It's just not right that two thirds of energy customers are stuck on the most expensive tariffs.
And it's just not right that the housing market continues to fail working people either.
Ask almost any question about social fairness or problems with our economy, and the answer so often comes back to housing.
High housing costs - and the growing gap between those on the property ladder and those who are not - lie at the heart of falling social mobility, falling savings and low productivity.
We will do everything we can to help people financially so they can buy their own home. That's why Help to Buy and Right to Buy are the right things to do.
But as Sajid said in his bold speech on Monday, there is an honest truth we need to address. We simply need to build more homes.
This means using the power of government to step in and repair the dysfunctional housing market.
It means using public sector land for more and faster house building.
It means encouraging new technologies that will help us to get more houses built faster. And putting in more government investment too.
It means stepping up and doing what's right for Britain.
Making the market work for working people.
Because that's what government can do.
And something else we need to do: take big, sometimes even controversial, decisions about our country's infrastructure.
Because we need to get Britain firing in all areas again.
It is why we will press ahead with plans for High Speed 2, linking London and Birmingham and, eventually, towns and cities in the North.
Why we will shortly announce a decision on expanding Britain's airport capacity.
And why - having reviewed the evidence and added important new national security safeguards - we signed up to Hinkley Point.
We will take the big decisions when they're the right decisions for Britain.
Because that's what government can do.
And we can make these big decisions because our economy is strong and because of the fiscal discipline we have shown over the last six years.
And we must continue to aim for a balanced budget.
But to build an economy that works for everyone, we must also invest in the things that matter, the things with a long-term return.
That is how we will address the weaknesses in our economy, improve our productivity, increase economic growth and ensure everyone gets a fair share.
And that's not the only reason.
Because while monetary policy - with super-low interest rates and quantitative easing - provided the necessary emergency medicine after the financial crash, we have to acknowledge there have been some bad side effects.
People with assets have got richer. People without them have suffered. People with mortgages have found their debts cheaper. People with savings have found themselves poorer.
A change has got to come. And we are going to deliver it.
Because that's what a Conservative Government can do.
This party will always be the party of businesses large and small.
But we must acknowledge that the way a small number of businesses behave fuels the frustration people feel.
It's not the norm. I know that most businesses and the people who run them are hardworking, entrepreneurial and public spirited at heart.
But the actions of a few tar the reputations of the many.
So the party that believes in business is going to change things to help support it.
Too often the people who are supposed to hold big business accountable are drawn from the same, narrow social and professional circles as the executive team.
And too often the scrutiny they provide is not good enough.
A change has got to come.
So later this year we will publish our plans to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.
Because we are the party of workers. Of those who put in the effort. Those who contribute and give of their best.
That's why we announced on Saturday that we're going to review our laws to make sure that, in our modern and flexible economy, people are properly protected at work.
That's right.
Workers' rights - not under threat from a Conservative government.
Workers' rights - protected and enhanced by a Conservative government.
And let me say something about tax.
We're all Conservatives here. We all believe in a low-tax economy. But we also know that tax is the price we pay for living in a civilised society.
Nobody, no individual tycoon and no single business, however rich, has succeeded on their own.
Their goods are transported by road, their workers are educated in schools, their customers are part of sophisticated networks taking in the private sector, the public sector and charities.
We've all played a part in that success.
So it doesn't matter to me who you are.
If you're a tax-dodger, we're coming after you.
If you're an accountant, a financial adviser or a middleman who helps people to avoid what they owe to society, we're coming after you too.
An economy that works for everyone is one where everyone plays by the same rules.
So whoever you are you - however rich or powerful - you have a duty to pay your tax.
And we're going to make sure you do.
This is a big agenda for change. But it is necessary and essential.
It is a programme for government to act to create an economy that works for everyone - an economy that's on the side of ordinary working class people.
And an economy that can support the vital public services and institutions upon which we all rely - to invest in the things we hold dear.
Like the NHS - one of the finest health care systems anywhere in the world, and a vital national institution.
An institution that reflects our values, our belief in fairness, and in which we all take enormous pride.
And I mean all.
Because there is complete cross-party support for the NHS.
For its status as a provider of free-at-the-point-of-use health care. For the thousands of doctors and nurses that work around the clock to care for their patients.
We all have a story about the nurse who cared for a loved one, or a surgeon who saved the life of a friend.
So let us take this opportunity to say to those doctors and nurses - thank you.
The NHS should unite us. But year after year, election after election, Labour try to use it to divide us.
At every election since it was established, Labour have said the Tories would cut the NHS - and every time we have spent more on it.
Every election, they say we want to privatise the NHS - and every time we have protected it.
In fact, the party that expanded the use of the private sector in the NHS the fastest was not this party, but the Labour Party.
The only party to ever cut spending on the NHS is not this party, but the Labour Party - that's what they did in Wales.
And at the last election, it wasn't the Labour Party that pledged to give the NHS the money it asked for to meet its five-year plan - it was this party, the Conservative Party...
investing an extra £10 billion in the NHS - more than its leaders asked for...
and this year more patients are being treated, and more operations are being carried out, by more doctors and more nurses than ever before.
That's a tribute to everyone who works in the NHS.
But also to one man - Jeremy Hunt - who is one of the most passionate advocates for patients and for the doctors, nurses and others who work in our health service that I have ever known.
So let's have no more of Labour's absurd belief that they have a monopoly on compassion.
Let's put an end to their sanctimonious pretence of moral superiority.
Let's make clear that they have given up the right to call themselves the party of the NHS, the party of the workers, the party of public servants.
They gave up that right when they adopted the politics of division. When their extreme ideological fixations led them to simply stop listening to the country.
When they abandoned the centre ground.
And let us take this opportunity to show that we, the Conservative Party, truly are the party of the workers...
the party of public servants...
the party of the NHS.
Because we believe in public service. We believe in investing in and supporting the institutions that make our country great.
We believe in the good that government can do.
Government cannot stand aside when it sees social injustice and unfairness. If we want to make sure Britain is a country that works for everyone, government has to act to make sure opportunity is fairly shared.
And I want us to be a country where it doesn't matter where you were born, who your parents are, where you went to school, what your accent sounds like, what god you worship, whether you're a man or a woman, gay or straight, or black or white.
All that should matter is the talent you have and how hard you're prepared to work.
But if we're honest we'll admit that's simply not the case for everyone today.
Advancement in today's Britain is still too often determined by wealth or circumstance.
By an accident of birth rather than talent.
By privilege not merit.
Rebalancing our economy is a start, but if we're serious about overturning some of the longstanding injustices and barriers that stop working people from getting on, we need that economic reform to be allied with genuine and deep social reform too.
Because a society that works for everyone is a society based on fairness. And only genuine social reform can deliver it.
Genuine social reform means helping more people onto the housing ladder. It means making sure every child has access to a good school place.
It means never writing off people who can work and consigning them to a life on benefits, but giving them the chance to go out and earn a living and to enjoy the dignity that comes with a job well done.
But for those who can't work, we must offer our full support - which is why it was so important that Damian Green announced on Saturday that we will end the mandatory retesting of those with chronic health conditions that only induces stress but does nothing at all to help.
And genuine social reform means addressing historic injustices that hold too many people back.
Some of my proudest moments as Home Secretary came when we began to tackle deep-seated and long-standing problems that few had dared to tackle before.
I introduced the first ever Modern Slavery Act, bringing in tough new penalties to put slave masters behind bars, with life sentences for the worst offenders.
I cut the police's use of stop and search by almost two thirds and reduced the disproportionate targeting of young, black men.
And I know our impressive new Home Secretary Amber Rudd is committed to carrying on that work.
But injustices remain.
If you are from a black Caribbean background, you are three times more likely to be permanently excluded from school than other children.
If you are a black woman, you are seven times more likely to be detained under mental health legislation than a white woman.
People in ethnic minority households are almost twice as likely to live in relative poverty as white people.
But it is not just those from minority backgrounds who are affected.
White working class boys are less likely to go to university than any other group in society.
We cannot let this stand - not if a country that works for everyone is the principle that binds us all together.
That's why I have launched an unprecedented audit of public services to shine a light on these racial disparities and let us do something about them.
Because they are all burning injustices, and I want this government - this Conservative Government - to fight every single one of them.
A society that works for everyone is one of fairness and opportunity. A society in which everyone has the chance to go as far as their talents will take them.
That's why in one of the first speeches I gave as Prime Minister I set out my plans to transform Britain into a Great Meritocracy.
And that starts in our schools.
I want Britain to be a country in which every child has access to a good school place that's right for that individual child.
Because Britain after Brexit will need to make use of all of the talent we have in this country.
We have come a long way.
Thanks to the free schools and academies programme and the efforts of teachers, heads and governors, there are now 1.4 million more children in good and outstanding schools compared with 2010.
But we need to go further. Because there are still one and a quarter million children in schools that are just not good enough.
And if you live in the Midlands or the North, you have less chance of attending a good school than children in the South.
This simply cannot go on.
That's why Justine Greening and I have set out a new package of reforms, building on Michael Gove's success, to increase the number of good school places across the country...
so there's not just a school place for every child, but a good school place for every child. A school place that suits the skills, interests and abilities of every single pupil.
That is why we want more of our great universities to set up or sponsor schools in the state sector - just as the University of Birmingham has done, a few miles from here.
It's why we are saying to the great private schools that - in return for their charitable tax status - we want them to do more to take on children without the means to pay, or set up and sponsor good state schools.
It is why we want more good faith schools for parents and pupils who want them.
And it is why we have said - where there is demand from parents, where they will definitely take pupils from all backgrounds, where they will play a part in improving the quality of all schools in their area - we will lift the ban on establishing new grammar schools too.
And here we see the challenge.
Because for too long politicians have said to people and communities who are crying out for change that they can't have what they want.
They've said we don't think you should have it, even though we might enjoy those very same things for ourselves.
And you end up in the absurd situation where you stop these good, popular, life-changing schools from opening - by law.
Imagine. Think of what that says.
If you're rich or well off, you can have a selective education for your child. You can send them to a selective private school. You can move to a better catchment area or afford to send them long distances to get the education you want.
But if you're not, you can't.
I can think of no better illustration of the problem - why ordinary working class people think it's one rule for them, and another for everyone else.
Because the message we are sending them is this: we will not allow their children to have the same opportunities that wealthier children enjoy.
That is a scandal and we - the Conservative Party - must bring it to an end.
So my vision is for Britain to be a Great Meritocracy.
That's what I've always believed in. The cause that everything I have ever done in politics has been designed to serve.
Because a country based on merit not privilege, is a country that's fair. And when we overcome unfairness and injustice, we can build that new united Britain that we need.
And united, we can do great things.
We saw that in the summer in Rio. We saw how individual success was powered by collective effort. How the dedication and talent of one was supported by a united team.
And how a government's determination - John Major's Conservative Government's determination - to step up and back Britain's sporting success contributed to such a remarkable result.
We were honoured to welcome four members of the team - Helen Richardson-Walsh, Dame Sarah Storey, Vicky Thornley and Andrew Triggs-Hodge - to our conference on Monday.
And to them - and to every athlete and every member of Team and Paralympics GB - we say, thank you. You did your country proud.
It was a memorable summer for British sport, but one moment stood out for me above all other.
It was not from Rio. It happened later. Just a couple of weeks ago on the sun-drenched streets of Cozumel in Mexico.
There, our celebrated triathlon champion Jonny Brownlee was heading for glory, the finishing line in sight, when he faltered. Stopped. And was falling exhausted to the ground.
And just behind him, his brother Alistair - a tough competitor who typically yields to no one - had the chance to run on and steal the prize.
But seeing his brother's struggle, he didn't pass on by. As other competitors ran past, he stopped. Reached out his hand. And gently carried him home.
And there in that moment, we saw revealed an essential truth. That we succeed or fail together. We achieve together or fall short together.
And when one among us falters, our most basic human instinct is to put our own self-interest aside, to reach out our hand and help them over the line.
That's why the central tenet of my belief is that there is more to life than individualism and self-interest.
We form families, communities, towns, cities, counties and nations. We have a responsibility to one another.
And I firmly believe that government has a responsibility too.
It is to act to encourage and nurture those relationships, networks and institutions - and to step up to correct injustices and tackle unfairness where it can - because these are the things that can drive us apart.
That's why I say today - as I have always said - that my mission - and the mission of this party - is to build a country that truly works for everyone, not just the privileged few.
It's why when I stood on the steps of Number 10 for the first time as Prime Minister 84 days ago, I said that the Government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the rich and powerful, but by the interests of ordinary, working class people.
And this week, we have shown the country that we mean business.
Not just protecting, but enhancing workers' rights.
Building an economy that's fair, where everyone plays by the same rules.
Getting more houses built. More doctors in the NHS.
Investing in things that will make our economy grow.
Hundreds of great new schools. Universities and fee-paying schools helping state schools to improve.
And yes, where parents want them and where they'll improve standards for children of whatever background - the first new grammar schools to open in England for fifty years.
This is a bold plan to bring Britain together. To build a new united Britain, rooted in the centre ground.
An agenda for a new modern Conservatism. That understands the good government can do. That will never hesitate to face down the powerful when they abuse their positions of privilege.
That will always act in the interests of ordinary, working class people.
That's what government's about: action. It's about doing something, not being someone.
About identifying injustices, finding solutions, driving change. Taking, not shirking, the big decisions. Having the courage to see things through.
It's not always glamorous or exciting, but at its best it's a noble calling.
And where many just see government as the problem, I want to show it can be part of the solution too.
And I know this to be true.
For as I leave the door of my office at Number 10, I pass that famous staircase - the portraits of prime ministers past lined up along the wall.
Men - and of course one woman - of consequence, who have steered this country through difficult times - and changed it for the better too.
There's Disraeli, who saw division and worked to heal it. Churchill, who confronted evil and had the strength to overcome. Attlee, with the vision to build a great national institution. And Lady Thatcher who taught us we could dream great dreams again.
Those portraits remind me of the good that government can do.
That nothing good comes easy.
But with courage and vision and determination you can always see things through.
And as I pass them every day, I remember that our nation has been shaped by those who stepped up to be counted when the big moments came.
Such opportunities are rare, but we face such a moment today.
A moment that calls us to respond and to reshape our nation once again.
Not every generation is given this opportunity.
Not every generation called to step up in such a way.
But this is our generation's moment.
To write a new future upon the page.
To bring power home and make decisions... here in Britain.
To take back control and shape our future... here in Britain.
To build an outward looking, confident, trading nation... here in Britain.
To build a stronger, fairer, brighter future... here in Britain.
That is the opportunity we have been given.
And the responsibility to grasp it falls upon us all.
So to everyone here this morning - and the millions beyond whether leavers or remain - I say:
Come with me and we'll write that brighter future.
Come with me and we'll make that change.
Come with me as we rise to meet this moment.
Come with me and together let's seize the day.",0.9999226927757263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Mainstream
